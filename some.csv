Abate,"Something that <i>abates</i> becomes fewer or less intense. Your enthusiasm for skiing might <i>abate</i> after falling off a ski lift and getting a mouthful of snow.<br><br><i>Abate</i> comes from the Old French verb <i>abattre,</i> ""to beat down,"" and means to reduce or become less intense or numerous. As an intransitive verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or figuratively violent, as in ""the flood of fan mail began to <i>abate</i>."" Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or noise, you reduce them. Pronounce <i>abate</i> with the stress on the second syllable (uh-BATE)."
Abatement,"An <i>abatement</i> is a deduction, or lessening. If you start bluntly telling people what you think of them, you might see an <i>abatement</i> in their friendliness toward you.<br><br><i>Abatement</i> comes from the French word for batter, but <i>abatement</i> doesn’t usually have a negative sense––abatement reduces something, but doesn’t beat it to a pulp. Many cities offer tax abatements to reward businesses starting up in areas they want to develop. If your heat doesn't work, you could sue your landlord for a rent abatement, since you shouldn't have to pay rent for days you don't have heat."
Abhor,"If you <i>abhor</i> something, it gives you a feeling of complete hatred. Chances are you <i>abhor</i> that kid who used to torture the frogs in biology class.<br><br><i>Abhor</i> is from Latin <i>abhorrere</i> — ""to shrink back in horror."" It is the strongest way in English to express hatred, even stronger than <i>loathe</i>. We only use abhor in formal contexts; you might say ""I abhor that man,"" but you would be less likely to say ""I abhor spinach"" unless you tend to express yourself in highfalutin terms no matter what the occasion."
Abhorrent,"Many people find cruelty toward animals <i>abhorrent,</i> that is, they think it's detestable, obscene, repugnant, repulsive, and offensive to the mind. In other words, they really, really don't like it.<br><br>When you think of <i>abhorrent</i>, think of <i>horror,</i> as in something so vile and loathsome that you can only react to it in horror. In fact, the word <i>abhorrent</i> in Latin means “to recoil (back away) in horror.” Note that the ending is spelled <i>-ent</i> with an <i>e,</i> not an <i>a</i>. Maybe the <i>a</i> found <i>abhorrent</i> so abhorrent that it didn’t want to appear in it a second time."
Abide,"<i>Abide</i> means to be able to live with, or stand. If you can't <i>abide</i> with something, it means you can't stand it. If you can abide it, it means you can live with it.<br><br>An old definition of <i>abide</i> is 'to live'––think of <i>abode</i>, as in dwelling. If you abide by the rules, it means you live with them, and you will follow them. If you can't abide your sister's shrill violin playing, it means you can't live with it, you can't be in the house when she's practicing. You abide something you don't like, like your teacher's long stories about math. It's not a pleasant experience, but what choice do you have?"
Ablation,"An <i>ablation</i> is removing a body part, organ, or tissue surgically. If a doctor takes out one of your kidneys, that's an <i>ablation</i>.<br><br>This Latinate noun from the little-used verb <i>ablate </i> refers to the surgical removal of tissue from someone's body. This is a general term that applies to the surgical removal of any part of the patient's body.  If an oncologist is removing a cancerous growth, that's an ablation. If a limb is being amputated, that's an ablation. If a dentist pulls out a tooth, that's an ablation. The other kind of ablation is also a reduction: the melting of glaciers."
Ablution,"An <i>ablution</i> is a washing or a cleaning of oneself, for personal hygiene, or a ritual washing or cleaning associated with religious observance.<br><br>The word <i>ablution</i> comes from the Latin <i>abluere,</i> meaning ""to wash away."" Back in the Middle Ages this term referred to the use of liquids for purification in chemistry; it later took on religious meaning. All the major religions have some rituals of purification. Examples include the washing of the hands or feet, and the cleansing of sacred containers or other objects."
Abound,"When things <i>abound</i>, there are a lot of them. In spring, birds, flowers, rain, and frisbees <i>abound</i>.<br><br>This word has to do with an abundance of something. In cities like Buffalo, NY, snow abounds. In very hot weather, insects and suntan lotion abound. Dogs are happy at the park when squirrels abound — meaning there are a lot of squirrels. On the moon, rocks abound, but that's about it."
Absolve,"To be <i>absolved</i> is to be let off the hook, to be set free from a certain obligation or to be forgiven for a wrongdoing. The Church may absolve you of your sins, but that won't absolve you of the need to attend mass.<br><br>The Latin <i>absolvere</i>, which means ""to set free,"" is the root of the word <i>absolve</i>. In the religious sense, to be absolved means to be truly forgiven in the eyes of the Lord, which must feel like being set free. In a more mundane everyday usage, <i>absolve</i> can be used to describe being let off the hook. For instance, putting a campaign poster in your window does not absolve you of the responsibility to vote."
Abstain,"If you <i>abstain</i> from something, you restrain yourself from consuming it. People usually <i>abstain</i> from things that are considered vices — like drinking alcohol or eating chocolate.<br><br>Roots of the word <i>abstain</i> are from the 14th-century French, ""to withhold oneself,"" and the word often refers to people who abstain or keep themselves from drinking liquor. The noun form <i>abstinence</i> also pops up often in reference to abstinence programs that urge teens to abstain from premarital sex. <i>Abstain</i> can also mean to withhold a vote, and sometimes a difficult decision is held up when government representatives abstain from voting one way or another."
Accolade,"A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest form of <i>accolade</i>. Today, an <i>accolade</i> is more than a way to bestow knighthood, it is a form of praise or an award.<br><br>In the early 17th century, the French <i>accoler</i> meant to ""embrace the neck,"" which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th century, <i>accolade</i> came to mean ""award."" A person who achieves a goal in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or trophy, an accolade of achievement, while a performer or speaker might get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience. Rarely does either of these types of accolade involve a sword."
Accoutrement,"Does that shiny new car come with all the bells and whistles? Then it has plenty of <i>accoutrements</i>, or accessories.<br><br>Say <i>accoutrement</i> with a French accent and you'll be referring to an outfit — a particularly bizarre outfit. But when we borrowed the word from France, it evolved to refer to any kind of trappings or extras, especially clothing accessories. So an accoutrement can be anything from a belt or bangles, to extra cup holders and heated bucket seats."
Acquit,"To <i>acquit</i> someone is to clear them of charges. <i>Acquitting</i> also has to do with how you carry or present yourself.<br><br>If you're accused of a crime, then the best thing that can happen to you is being acquitted — that means you were cleared or exonerated of the charges. A defense lawyer wants to have his client acquitted. But watch out for another unrelated meaning: <i>acquitting</i> can mean how you behave, conduct, or carry yourself. If you acquit yourself like a champion, then you're acting like a champion."
Actuary,"The person who calculates the risks for an insurance company or financial institution is known as an <i>actuary</i>. Her job is to analyze the statistics for accidents and life expectancy, which helps the company set the price of insurance coverage.<br><br>An <i>actuary</i> is a risk-management professional who works with mathematical probabilities and other accounting techniques. The current meaning of the word didn't come into use until 1772, although actuarial science had been in use long before that. (The first acknowledged U.S. actuary was Jacob Shoemaker in 1809.) Before that, the word <i>actuary</i> meant someone who was a registrar or clerk. It derives from the Latin word <i>actuarius</i> ""account-keeper,"" which in turn came from  <i>āctus</i> ""public business."""
Adage,"An <i>adage</i> is a saying. Moms and dads love <i>adages</i> such as ""early to bed, early to rise"" and ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away.""<br><br>The noun <i>adage</i> comes from the Latin root, <i>aio</i>, meaning ""I say."" Like a proverb, an <i>adage</i> can be true or not so much. It's a folksy saying that's been passed around for so long that it doesn't even matter if it's true anymore. <i>Adages</i> can be wise and wisecracking, such as this quote from Alice Roosevelt Longworth: ""I've always believed in the <i>adage</i> that the secret of eternal youth is arrested development."" There's a Book of Proverbs in the Bible, but <i>adages</i> can show up anywhere, even cross-stitched on a pillow."
Adamant 1.,"If you stubbornly refuse to change your mind about something, you are <i>adamant</i> about it.<br><br>This word's story begins in ancient Greece, where philosophers spoke about a legendary unbreakable stone or metal they called <i>adamas</i> (literally, ""invincible""). In English, people began to use the word to refer to something that cannot be altered, and then in the twentieth century — after <i>adamant</i> had been in English for about a thousand years — it came to be used as an adjective to mean ""unyielding as stone."" If you're adamant about something, no amount of persuasion is going to convince you otherwise."

If you're adamant about something, no amount of persuasion is going to convince you otherwise."
Addendum,"When you make an <i>addendum</i> to a document, you are adding text to the end. <i>Addenda</i> tend to be serious business as they're added to contracts, reports, and studies.<br><br>There is nothing dumb about an addendum; often an addendum makes a document ""smarter"" by adding more information. If you did a science report on plant growth and found that after your study was complete, the plant flowered in an unusual way, you might describe that as an <i>addendum</i> to your report. Fun fact: the plural of <i>addendum</i> is <i>addenda</i>."
Adept 1.,"Are you looking for another word to describe a person who is highly skilled, very proficient or expert at something? Try the adjective <i>adept</i>!<br><br>In the days of Medieval Latin, an <i>adeptus</i> was a person who had learned the secrets of alchemy. Although an <i>adept</i> person today cannot turn lead into gold, the adjective is still high praise meaning ""skilled, expert, highly proficient."""

Adjunct 1.,"<i>Adjunct</i> means something added on, but not part of the whole. An <i>adjunct</i> professor is someone who is hired by a college to teach but isn't a full member of the faculty.<br><br>This is a word you can figure out by taking it apart. From <i>ad-</i> ""to"" and <i>-junct</i> ""join"" (think ""junction""), you can see that this is about joining something to another. ""During lunch, Tim always sat the girls' lacrosse-team lunch table, and they joked that he was an <i>adjunct</i> member of the team."""

Admonish,"To <i>admonish</i> is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, <i>admonish</i> him. It sounds better than ""scolding,"" and it's less painful than spanking.<br><br>Coming to English through Old French from the Latin <i>admonere</i> ""to advise, remind,"" <i>admonish</i> is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means ""scold"" or ""rebuke"" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, <i>warn</i> or <i>advise</i> are closer synonyms."
Admonition,"Bringing a skateboard to school is a great way to get an <i>admonition</i> from a teacher not to ride it down the halls. An <i>admonition</i> is advice with a hint of scolding, a warning not to do something.<br><br>When you're cautioned or warned about some mistake you might be just about to make, or some looming danger, you're receiving an admonition. The strength and tone of an admonition determine whether it's a gentle, polite suggestion or more of a stern warning. In Scotland, an <i>admonition</i> is an official legal term that means a verbal punishment for someone who's been found guilty but set free."
Advent,"The <i>advent</i> of something means that it's finally here. You might be waiting for the <i>advent</i> of a new iPhone or for the <i>advent</i> of cloning. Don't hold your breath.<br><br>Generally, the noun <i>advent</i> is used for the introduction of something important. The twentieth century saw the advent of many important inventions — including television, computers, and microwave dinners. If the word is capitalized, it has a religious meaning, referring to the period, observed in certain Christian religions, that begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas (December 25)."
Advocate 1.,"An <i>advocate</i> (AD-və-kit) is someone who supports a cause, like an <i>advocate</i> for outdoor recess. <i>Advocate</i> (AD-və-kate) is also a verb meaning to speak in favor of, so you can <i>advocate</i> for that outdoor recess by urging your school to play outside!<br><br>As a noun, an <i>advocate</i> is a person who represents another person’s interests, like a lawyer does. In fact, the word comes from the courtroom – it’s from Latin <i>advocare</i>, to “add” a “voice.” To advocate is to add a voice of support to a cause or person. An advocate is anyone who adds that voice by representing another person in court, or by supporting or working toward a particular course of action."

Affable,"<i>Affable</i> means friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to. An <i>affable</i> host offers you something to drink and makes you feel at home.<br><br>The adjective <i>affable</i> entered English by way of the Latin word <i>affābilis</i>, which means ""kind, friendly."" If you’re stuck on an airplane next to someone affable, the trip won’t be so bad because that person will be easy to chat with but won’t talk your ear off. Synonyms of <i>affable</i> also refer to a pleasant and mild friendliness, such as <i>genial</i>, <i>hospitable</i>, and <i>gracious</i>. Affable people generally seem like they’re in a good mood and are happy to see you."
Affectation,"The guy at your local coffee shop who's never left the state but speaks as though he's lived in London all his life? His British accent is an <i>affectation</i>.<br><br>Never confuse <i>affectation</i> with <i>affection</i> — which means “love” or “tenderness.” While affection might not always be genuine, <i>affectation</i> is never the real thing. In fact, affectation is all about faking it. Do you believe the politician cares about poor people, or do you think his concern is an affectation?"
Affix 1.,"When you <i>affix</i> something, you stick it on to something else. You might <i>affix</i> a stamp to a letter or <i>affix</i> colorful stickers to your notebook.<br><br>The verb <i>affix</i> often refers to physically attaching something — like when you affix a label onto a folder — but it can be used more broadly to describe adding on something. You might affix your signature to a contract. If you like grammar, you might already know that the noun form of <i>affix</i> refers to letters or words that can be tacked onto other base words to alter their meaning. For example, the prefix <i>un-</i> is an affix."

Affluent,"You know you're driving through an <i>affluent</i> neighborhood when you see large houses, perfect landscaping, and expensive cars. Use <i>affluent</i> to describe wealthy people or areas.<br><br>In Middle English, <i>affluent</i> meant ""abundant, flowing,"" from Old French, from Latin <i>affluēns</i>, from <i>affluere</i> ""to abound in,"" from the prefix <i>ad-</i> ""to, at"" plus <i>fluere</i> ""to flow."" The meaning of ""abundant, flowing"" is still seen in phrases such as ""<i>affluent</i> prose."" But mostly, when you use the word <i>affluent</i>, the thing understood to be flowing is cash."
Affront 1.,"An <i>affront</i> is an action that causes offense. If someone blows smoke in your face after you've asked him to put out his cigarette, you would consider it an <i>affront</i>.<br><br><i>Affronter</i> was an old French word meaning ""to confront"" or ""slap in the face."" It's from the Latin, <i>ad frontem,</i> meaning ""to the face."" Sure, a slap in the face would still be considered an affront, but other non-physical actions would also count. Some would even call a misplaced apostrophe an affront to the English language. Don't confuse <i>affront</i> with <i>effrontery,</i> which means ""presumptuousness."""

Aficionado,"If you really like something and make it your business to study up on its history and characteristics, you could be called an <i>aficionado</i> of that subject.<br><br>This sort of funny-looking word might seem like it needs a second “f,” but it really doesn’t, and you should hold out on the temptation to add another one. (The single “f” spelling is a result of the word’s Spanish heritage.) The word <i>aficionado</i> implies serious study and fervent interest — it’s often applied to lovers of wine, known as wine <i>aficionados</i> — but you can think of it as just a fancy way to say <i>fan</i>. You could call yourself a football <i>aficionado</i>, for example, if you think that sounds more impressive than just saying you’re a football fan. (Though that might get you beat up in certain bars.)"
Aforementioned,"Something that was mentioned before is <i>aforementioned</i>. Once you've written about something, it can then be referred to as <i>aforementioned</i>.<br><br>You already know that to mention something is to bring it up, so if you consider that <i>afore</i> sounds a little like <i>before</i>, you'll know that <i>aforementioned</i> is simply something that's been said previously. After your father has asked you to wash the dishes, do the laundry, and vacuum the rug, he might hand you five bucks upon completion of the aforementioned chores. This word shows up in writing more than speech. Writers often mention their own aforementioned ideas."
Agape,"If you’re watching a powerful display of nature such as an avalanche, you might stare at it with your mouth <i>agape</i>, which means your mouth would be wide open in awe. You should close it, before it is full of snow.<br><br><i>Agape</i>, you may have already figured out, comes from the verb <i>gape</i>, meaning ""to open wide or split."" This is what happens to your mouth when you are looking agape at something in amazement. Don’t confuse mouth-wide-open <i>agape</i> with the other <i>agape</i>, which is spelled the same but pronounced differently and refers to Christian love."
Agglomeration,"The word <i>agglomeration</i> is quite an <i>agglomeration</i> of letters, a big bunch of them.<br><br>Inside of <i>agglomeration</i> you see the word <i>glom</i> which means to become stuck or attached to something. An agglomeration is a bunch of stuff that has glommed onto each other. Try not to confuse the word with <i>abomination</i> which is an awful and reprehensible thing. If you had an agglomeration of abominations, you'd have more than a handful of hateful objects."
Agnostic 1.,"If someone believes they cannot know whether or not God exists, label them an <i>agnostic</i>. A bad joke: Did you hear about the dyslexic <i>agnostic</i> insomniac? He stayed up all night wondering if there was a dog.<br><br>In 1869, English biologist T.H. Huxley coined this noun referring to someone whose religious beliefs lie somewhere in between those of a theist and an atheist — that is, a believer and a disbeliever in God. Huxley combined the Greek prefix <i>a-</i>, meaning ""not,"" with <i>gnostos</i>, ""known."" It can be used as a noun or  adjective, and it can also refer to uncertainty about questions other than the existence of God: ""Some philosophers remain <i>agnostic</i> as to whether people have free will."""

Alienate,"When you <i>alienate</i> people, you make them stop liking or caring about you. Show up at a conference of cat lovers with a sign around your neck that says, ""I hate kittens,"" and you'll learn firsthand what that means.<br><br>Back in the days of Latin, before the word <i>alien</i> came to mean little green men from outer space, it described something or someone that was foreign or different or not known: an alien custom, an alien nation. When you alienate people, you make them WISH you were an alien, or at least that they could send you to the moon."
Allege,"If you accuse someone of committing a crime but the proof of the wrongdoing isn't yet found, use the verb <i>allege</i>. You might <i>allege</i> that your sister broke a vase, just because no one else was home when you heard the crash.<br><br>If you ever watch news programs, you often hear the verb <i>allege</i>. A reporter might say that detectives allege that a certain person, who is now being held without bail, set a fire. This can be confusing: If the person is in jail, then he or she must have set that fire, right? In reality, the person is a suspect, awaiting trial. In our country, people are assumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. That's why we used <i>allege</i> until we know for sure."
Alleviate,"Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to <i>alleviate</i>, or relieve, your pain.<br><br>The verb, <i>alleviate,</i> stems from the Latin root, <i>levis</i> ""light"" and is related to modern English words such as <i>elevator</i> and <i>levitate</i> — both words implying a lightening of one's load. <i>Alleviate</i> also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger."
Aloof,"Someone who's <i>aloof</i> isn't warm and friendly, instead being distant and reserved. That emotionally cold and detached fellow who keeps to himself, drinking espresso and reading French philosophy, would best be described as <i>aloof</i>.<br><br>In Middle English, <i>aloof</i> was originally a nautical term; the <i>loof</i> (now spelled <i>luff</i>) is the windward side of a ship. Smart sailors wanting to avoid a hazard on the leeward side would give the order, ""A loof!"" From this command we get the idea of steering clear of something (or someone). In modern usage the word has taken on a negative connotation: an aloof person is often considered cold or snobby."
Amenable,"If your friends want to try sky diving and you're <i>amenable</i> to the idea, sounds like you're going to be jumping out of a plane. If a person or thing is <i>amenable</i> to something, they are ready, willing, or responsive.<br><br>Note that <i>amenable</i> is often followed by the preposition <i>to</i>, which makes <i>amenable</i> mean ""able to be controlled or affected by something,"" as in ""They are usually <i>amenable</i> to our wishes;"" or ""Her heart condition is not <i>amenable</i> to treatment."" An <i>amenable</i> personality is open to influence or control and is willing to agree or yield."
Amiable,"A friendly, pleasant person could be described as <i>amiable</i>. Airline flight attendants tend to be <i>amiable</i>. The people monitoring the school's cafeteria? Maybe not.<br><br>An <i>amiable</i> person is good-natured and easy to get along with. Add one letter and you get <i>amicable</i>, a word with a common ancestor (Latin <i>amicabilis</i>) and a similar meaning. But while <i>amiable</i> refers to friendly people, <i>amicable</i> refers to friendly relations between them; two amiable people who no longer want to be married to one another might have an amicable divorce."
Amicable,"The adjective <i>amicable</i> means ""friendly"" — but in particular, use it when describing relations one might otherwise expect to be <i>un</i>friendly. The end of a romantic relationship that's less than <i>amicable</i> might involve broken dishes or broken bones.<br><br><i>Amicable</i>, not surprisingly, comes from the Latin word for ""friend,"" <i>amicus</i>. Perhaps the things most commonly described as <i>amicable</i> are <i>divorces</i>. The parties in a divorce often tend to be so childish and the proceedings so messy that it's nice to have a word that reflects the absence of those qualities. Other nouns that commonly pair with <i>amicable</i> include <i>relationship, split, parting, solution,</i> and <i>breakup</i>."
Amiss 1.,"When things are out of their proper places or not happening the way they should, we say they are <i>amiss</i>. And remember, <i>amiss</i> is as good as a mile.<br><br>The word <i>amiss</i> can be used as an adverb, as in the sentence, ""I spoke <i>amiss</i>."" Or you could use it as an adjective, as when you think something is wrong or missing — ""Something in the room is <i>amiss</i>."" Either way, <i>amiss</i> refers to something that is wrong, off the mark, or ""missed"" (note the connection). Once in a while, the word <i>amiss</i> can imply that something fishy or foul has taken place. In <i>Hamlet</i>, when Marcellus said, ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,"" he might as well have said, ""Something in Denmark is <i>amiss</i>."""

Ample,"<i>Ample</i> describes an abundance of something. An <i>ample</i> supply of apple muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is <i>ample</i> legroom in your new van, but you probably don't want your <i>ample</i> waistline spilling over the top of your jeans.<br><br>Like <i>amplify</i> (crank up the volume), <i>ample</i> is from the Latin word <i>amplus</i>, meaning ""large or spacious"" and has the word <i>plus</i> in it, like <i>plus</i>-sized models. <i>Ample</i> can be enough or even too much of something. It's great when there's <i>ample</i> parking or water for the hike, but there are things that some people don't want more of, like extra pounds. It's a cheeky insult to tell someone he or she has <i>ample</i> thighs, but we'd all be happy if we had <i>ample</i> time and money."
Ancillary 1.,"If you use the adjective <i>ancillary</i> to describe your position you are subordinate or supporting something or someone else.<br><br>The adjective <i>ancillary</i> originally meant ""relating to maidservants"" from the Latin, but the element of a female servant has fallen away and now the word merely refers to a position as helpful or subordinate. An example of how something in medicine can be <i>ancillary</i> is after you have surgery you may also take a drug to aid healing — the drug would be considered <i>ancillary</i> to the surgery. One could also argue that in the United States the vice-president takes an ancillary role to the president."

An example of how something in medicine can be <i>ancillary</i> is after you have surgery you may also take a drug to aid healing — the drug would be considered <i>ancillary</i> to the surgery. One could also argue that in the United States the vice-president takes an ancillary role to the president."
Annex 1.,"An <i>annex</i> is an extension of or an addition to a building. A small room off of a main room is an <i>annex,</i> and attics are another type of annex.<br><br>As a noun, an <i>annex</i> is part of a building or an addition to a main structure, or it can be an attachment, as in ""an annex to the current plans."" When used as a verb, the word means something a little different. Sometimes <i>annex</i> is used as a nice word for ""take"" or ""grab,"" as when Nazi Germany took the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and added it to their own territory. In order to <i>annex</i> something to what is yours, you have to take it away from someone else."

Antechamber,"An <i>antechamber</i> is an entryway or a small room that leads into a larger one. If you visit a friend who lives in a mansion, her butler may ask you to wait in the <i>antechamber</i> while he summons her.<br><br>You're most likely to come across an antechamber in a very grand building or home — in most houses, a similar room would probably be called a ""foyer"" or a ""hall."" Sometimes the area where you wait before entering a museum or office is called an <i>antechamber</i>, but it's more often just a ""waiting room."" Palaces and crypts and pyramids often have antechambers. The word comes from the French <i>antichambre</i>."
Antithesis,"An <i>antithesis</i> is the complete opposite of something. Though the counterculture was strong in America in 1968, voters elected Richard Nixon, the <i>antithesis</i> of a hippie.<br><br>The noun <i>antithesis</i> comes from a Greek root meaning ""opposition"" and ""set against."" It's often used today when describing two ideas or terms that are placed in strong contrast to each other. We might come across <i>antithesis</i> in school if we learn about the ""Hegelian dialectic."" There, the <i>thesis</i>, or main idea put forward in an argument, is countered with its opposite idea — the <i>antithesis</i> — and the two are finally reconciled in a third proposition, the <i>synthesis</i>. An <i>antithesis</i> wouldn't exist without a <i>thesis</i> because it works as a comparison."
Apace,"When something happens <i>apace</i>, it happens quickly. You could say that despite the rain, your house painting project is still continuing <i>apace</i>.<br><br>You're most likely to see the adverb <i>apace</i> describing some kind of work, and it's usually paired up with the verb <i>continue</i>. A harried theater director might insist that progress on the new play continues apace, or you might notice that your next door neighbor's chicken coop construction is continuing apace, progressing rapidly. The literal meaning of the 14th century phrase <i>a pace</i> was ""at a pace,"" or ""at a good pace."""
Arbitrary,"Something that's <i>arbitrary</i> seems like it's chosen at random instead of following a consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach using a totally <i>arbitrary</i> method to pick starting players.<br><br>Even though <i>arbitrary</i> comes from a word meaning ""judge"" (<i>arbiter</i>), that doesn't mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker <i>arbitrary</i> is usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making rules based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be picking names out of a hat."
Ardent,"If you are <i>ardent</i>, you are passionate about something. A pop star's <i>ardent</i> admirers might go so crazy at his concert that they faint from excitement.<br><br><i>Ardent</i> is most often used to modify words like <i>supporter, fan, advocate, admirer,</i> and <i>defender</i> — but also <i>opponent</i>. Although you can either ardently support or oppose something, support is by far the more common use. The word literally means ""burning"" or ""glowing"" — it's from Latin <i>ardere</i>, ""to burn."" In poetic use, the word is sometimes used to mean ""glowing,"" as Alexander Pope did in his 1718 translation of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>: ""From rank to rank she darts her <i>ardent</i> eyes."""
Arduous,"Use the adjective, <i>arduous,</i> to describe an activity that takes a lot of effort. Writing all those college essays and filling out the applications is an <i>arduous</i> process!<br><br><i>Arduous</i> was first used in English to mean ""steep"" or ""difficult to climb."" If you're an outdoorsman, hiking up a mountain is a lot of fun, but if you're a couch potato, it's an arduous trek. Today, the word can be used figuratively for something that is difficult or takes a lot of work. If you spend an arduous week studying for your final exams, you'll do well because you've worked really hard!"
Ascribe,"<i>Ascribe</i> means to give credit to, like if you <i>ascribe</i> the A you got on your group project to the hard work of your partners!<br><br><i>Ascribe's</i> Latin root is <i>ascribere</i>, meaning basically ""to write in.'' Makes sense, because <i>ascribe</i> is often used to link writers to their words. Many a quirky quote, like ""Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter,"" is ascribed to that famous scribe Mark Twain. It can also be a way of blaming something —  you might ascribe your bad attitude to your mom because she won't let you have cupcakes for dinner."
Askance,"You may have trouble looking directly at the human specimens onstage at the freak show, but you also won't be able to look away. Find a happy medium by looking <i>askance</i>, or subtly out of the corner of your eye.<br><br>First used in the 1500's, no one is quite sure where the cockeyed, slanting adverb <i>askance</i> came from. Some people suspect that it evolved from the Latin <i>a scancio</i>, meaning “obliquely, slantingly,” while others argue that it’s just a variant of the word <i>askew</i>. How fitting for a word that describes a suspicious or distrusting manner of looking that we can't trace its etymology with any surety."
Asphyxiate,"To <i>asphyxiate</i> is to keep someone from breathing — to suffocate or smother them. Choking on a piece of food can <i>asphyxiate</i> a person.<br><br>Your body needs to breathe oxygen in order to function, and when it's deprived of oxygen that's called <i>asphyxia</i> or <i>asphyxiation</i>. If a person stops being able to breathe, you can also say they <i>asphyxiate</i>. The origin of this verb is <i>asphyxia</i>, ""stopping of the pulse,"" in Greek, which originally had the same meaning in English, before it came to mean ""suffocation."""
Aspiring,"If you're <i>aspiring</i>, you're trying to be something. If you're an <i>aspiring</i> singer, you're probably out booking as many gigs as possible in the hopes that someone will soon discover you.<br><br>The adjective <i>aspiring</i> describes a person who wants to succeed at a particular goal, often one related to a career. Many aspiring artists move to New York City in the hopes that they'll get into a major gallery and sell their art. Aspiring country musicians move to Nashville to try to land a recording deal. If you're an aspiring politician, you may study political science and intern at the state senator's offices to gain experience and make connections."
Assemblage,"An <i>assemblage</i> is a bunch of parts, pieces, or people collected together into an organized group, always for some specific purpose.<br><br>On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech in Washington DC to hundreds of thousands of citizens — an assemblage of people who all wanted to end racism.  A computer is an assemblage of wires and microchips.  An artist who makes sculptures from trash creates assemblages of recycled materials.  The word <i>assemblage</i> is related to <i>assembly</i> — which sometimes refers to a gathering in the gymnasium that you’d like to skip."
Assiduous,"If you call someone <i>assiduous</i>, it's a compliment. It means they're careful, methodical and very persistent. Good detectives are classically <i>assiduous</i> types.<br><br><i>Assiduous</i> comes from two Latin words: <i>assiduus,</i> meaning ""busy incessant, continual or constant,"" and <i>assidere,</i> meaning ""to sit down to"" something. (Funnily enough, we also get the word <i>sedentary,</i> meaning someone who doesn't move around much, a lazy couch potato, from this same last word.) Although we tend to think of sedentary types as being the very opposite of assiduous ones, many assiduous activities (like writing, thinking, or detective work) are best done sitting in a chair."
Astonishing,"Something <i>astonishing</i> is astounding, staggering, stupefying, amazing, or incredible. It's not something you see every day.<br><br>This is a pretty strong word. A dog shaking hands is not astonishing, but a dog calling 911 for its owner definitely is. Astonishing things are amazing; they blow your mind. When people first walked on the moon, that was astonishing. Miracles are astonishing. If you say, ""Holy cow! I can't believe what I'm seeing,"" you're probably seeing something astonishing."
Astounding,"<i>Astounding</i> is an adjective that describes something bewildering, like the <i>astounding</i> sight of a dog walking on two legs.<br><br>When something is astounding, you might find yourself unable to speak — after all, <i>astounding</i> comes from the Middle English word <i>astouned</i>, meaning ""to stun."" If you see something that's astounding, you might just stare and stare, speechless. <i>Astounding</i> also describes something so surprisingly impressive that it overwhelms, like the astounding news that you just won the lottery."
Atrocious,"<i>Atrocious</i> is a great word, but there's nothing good about its meaning or its synonyms: <i>horrible,</i> <i>ugly,</i> <i>abominable,</i> <i>dreadful,</i> <i>unspeakable,</i> and <i>monstrous,</i> to name just a few.<br><br>The adjective <i>atrocious</i> is descended from the Latin <i>atrox,</i> which means ""fierce"" and ""cruel."" We hear this word all the time when something provokes horror (like a massive earthquake), when something is exceptionally bad or displeasing (like the worst movie we've ever seen, and the worse acting), or when we see something shockingly brutal or cruel (like an act of terrorism)."
Attainable,"You can do it, no doubt about it. Yes, your goal is <i>attainable</i>: within reach and not too difficult to achieve.<br><br><i>Attainable</i> has roots in Latin words that mean “to reach” and “to touch.”  If you can reach it and you can touch it, you’ve practically got it, and it’s clearly attainable.  The box on the top shelf is attainable once you get a chair to stand on.  Saving enough money for a car is an attainable goal if you’ve got a job that pays well.  Keep visiting this site and a good vocabulary is attainable — guaranteed."
Attire 1.,"The noun <i>attire</i> is just a formal way to say ""outfit."" And if you’re going outside in the middle of a blizzard, your <i>attire</i> should include more than a bathing suit and flip-flops.<br><br><i>Attire</i> can also refer to the antlers of a deer, but that’s a pretty obscure definition. So let's stick to the more common uses: put it into verb form and it means ""to dress or clothe."" Which makes sense, since it comes to us from the Old French <i>atirier</i>, meaning “to equip, ready or prepare.” Charles Dickens wrote that “Great men are seldom over-scrupulous in the arrangement of their <i>attire</i>"" —  meaning the clothes do not make the man."

Auburn 1.,"<i>Auburn</i> is a reddish-brown color. If you ask a hairdresser to color your hair <i>auburn</i>, you'll be disappointed to end up with bright red curls.<br><br><i>Auburn</i> almost always describes hair color — you might talk about your favorite childhood doll's long auburn hair, for example. The earliest meaning of <i>auburn</i> was ""yellowish-white,"" not ""reddish-brown,"" from the Medieval Latin <i>alburnus</i>, ""off-white"" or ""whitish,"" from the Latin <i>albus</i>, or ""white."" In the 16th century it was influenced by the Middle English word <i>brun</i>, ""brown,"" and the meaning changed."

Autism,"<i>Autism</i> is a neurological condition that's marked by differences in learning styles, passionate interests in specific subjects, repetitive motion, and sometimes difficulty with language and communication.<br><br>The word <i>autism</i> is taken directly from the Greek root <i>auto</i>, meaning “self.” Because autistic people may display a wide variety of characteristics, autism is defined as a range of conditions, known as the <i>autism spectrum</i>. This spectrum varies from those who have a hard time with social interaction to people who aren't able to speak. In some cases, autism is a diagnosis given by a doctor, while in others it's embraced by a person who self-identifies as autistic. A person who has autism is described as <i>autistic</i>."
Avert,"To <i>avert</i> is to turn away or to prevent. You might <i>avert</i> your gaze or <i>avert</i> a disaster — either way, you are avoiding something.<br><br>The verb <i>avert</i> comes from Latin roots that mean ""to turn away from."" <i>Averting</i> has that sense of deflecting, turning away, or preventing something (usually bad) from happening. You might put salt on an icy sidewalk to avert accidents, or you might avert a toddler's meltdown by supplying a lollipop."
Avian 1.,"Anything <i>avian</i> relates to birds. <i>Avian</i> flu is the bird flu, which birds can pass to humans.<br><br>Someone who flies a plane is an aviator, and that may help you remember that avian things have to do with birds. Feathers are part of avian anatomy. Laying eggs is the avian method of reproduction. Bird-watchers are avian experts who know how to tell birds apart. Ornithologists are also avian experts: they’re scientists who study birds."

Avid,"<i>Avid</i> usually means very eager or enthusiastic. If you're an <i>avid</i> reader, it means you read as much as you can, whenever you can.<br><br>But this adjective can also mean wanting something so much that you can be thought of as greedy. For example, a person can be <i>avid</i> for success or power. <i>Avid</i> is from French <i>avide,</i> from Latin <i>avidus,</i> from <i>avere</i> ""to desire, crave."""
Awhile,"When you've been doing something <i>awhile</i>, you've been doing something for an indefinite amount of time: it could be a little while or a long while.<br><br>This is a word that's hard to figure out without context. <i>Awhile</i> always applies to time, but the amount of time can be small or large. You could say you've been waiting awhile in line at the bank: that might mean 15 minutes. On the other hand, if you haven't heard from a friend in months, you could say, ""Wow... It's been <i>awhile</i>!"" Like a <i>bit</i> or a <i>load</i>, you can't measure <i>awhile</i>."
Barnacle,"A <i>barnacle</i> is a spineless animal that looks like a small circular white rock. You'll often find <i>barnacles</i> attached to the bottom of boats.<br><br>Barnacles are crustaceans, which means they're related to crabs, lobsters, and shrimp, all of which have an external shell. In the case of barnacles, their shells attach to things like rocks, other shells, docks, and boats, and stay there permanently, filtering food from shallow ocean water through feathery appendages. The earliest use of the word referred to a European goose whose mythology described it hatching from the marine crustacean that eventually took its name."
Bawl 1.,"To <i>bawl</i> is to weep or wail loudly. If you tend to <i>bawl</i> at sad movies, you might want to bring some tissues for wiping your tears and blowing your nose.<br><br>If a baby bawls all night, he doesn't just cry — he sobs and howls. You can also use the verb to talk about other loud sounds, like shouts: ""He <i>bawls</i> out orders while we stand there, confused,"" or even amusement: ""She <i>bawls</i> with laughter all through the woman's strange speech."" In the 15th century, to <i>bawl</i> was to ""bark like a dog,"" from the Old Norse <i>baula</i>, ""to low or moo like a cow."""

Bedevil,"To <i>bedevil</i> is to ""be"" a bit like a ""devil."" To <i>bedevil</i> means to cause trouble, or, when talking about a person, to torment or harass.<br><br>Bedevil has nothing to do with the eggs you eat on a picnic. Those are just plain deviled. And although, in the 1570s, <i>bedeviled</i> could be taken to mean literally ""possessed,"" the word no longer involves an actual devil, either. It just applies to people or things that make trouble like a devil would want to do."
Befuddle,"To <i>befuddle</i> is to confuse. A sticky exam question can <i>befuddle</i> you, or an awkward question about your whereabouts the night before (how can you remember? You were <i>befuddled,</i> after all.)<br><br>In sixteenth century Britain a popular thing to do (about the only thing to do) after the hogs had been fed and the chickens put away for the night was <i>fuddle</i> — in other words get pretty drunk. <i>Befuddled</i> was simply the confused state too many pots of mead put your poor brain in, and that's still its basic meaning today. Nowadays, <i>befuddle</i> has a more general meaning of confusion and uncertainty not necessarily caused by too much booze."
Beget,"To <i>beget</i> means to generate something, usually children, and it can be used to refer to the role of either a mother or a father.<br><br>If we analyze the word <i>beget</i>, we get the prefix <i>be-</i>, which tends to intensify the meaning of the following verb, and <i>get</i>, which means to cause something to enter one's possession. The word is usually used to refer to having children, although it can be used to refer to anything that generates something else — for example, an inspiration can beget a brilliant idea."
Begrudge,"To <i>begrudge</i> someone for something is to wish them ill for it or to envy them. Try not to <i>begrudge</i> his getting the promotion over you — he's been at the company longer.<br><br>An understudy might <i>begrudge</i> the lead her role and even go so far as to put glass in her shoes so she can't perform. An easy way to remember the meaning of this verb is to note the noun <i>grudge</i> lurking inside it. A grudge is ill will that you hold toward someone: to begrudge is to hold that grudge. If you begrudge your friend his happiness because he got the nicer car, your friendship will suffer."
Behoove,"To <i>behoove</i> someone to do something is to make it advisable or necessary to do so, for their own good or that of others.<br><br>It would behoove you to study hard and work for the future you desire. It would behoove the legislature to pass a law behooving citizens to pay their taxes earlier. <i>Behoove</i> comes from the Old English word <i>behofian</i>, which means ""to be of use."""
Belated,"Something <i>belated</i> comes after the fact. If you are late to deliver a birthday greeting, then make it a ""happy <i>belated</i> birthday"" card.<br><br>Belated Christmas gifts come after December 25. Belated birthday greetings are still sweet, but a belated New Year's Eve party? Sort of pointless. <i>Belated</i> can refer to less effective actions when used in more significant settings — consider ""a <i>belated</i> push to secure tax breaks for the working poor"" or ""a <i>belated</i> apology for indiscretions committed during the senator's scandalous college years."""
Belie,"To <i>belie</i> means to contradict. If you are 93 but look like you are 53, then your young looks <i>belie</i> your age.<br><br>We get <i>belie</i> from the Old English <i>beleogan</i>, which meant ""to deceive by lying."" It suggests characteristics or behavior that inadvertently or deliberately hide the truth. To remember it, just think ""be lying."" Snow White's decision to barge into the Seven Dwarfs' home without invitation belied her gentle nature."
Belittle,"To <i>belittle</i> means to put down, or to make another person feel as though they aren't important. Saying mean things about another person literally makes them feel ""little.""<br><br>To belittle someone is a cruel way of making someone else seem less important than yourself. A candidate for office might belittle his opponent by pointing out during a press conference that his fellow candidate has an inferior intellect. Belittling doesn't have to come in the form of verbal abuse. A manager who forces his administrative assistant to scrub his office floor with a toothbrush belittles her as well."
Belligerent 1.,"If someone is <i>belligerent</i>, they're eager to fight. It's a good idea to avoid hardcore hockey fans after their team loses — they tend to be <i>belligerent</i>.<br><br><i>Belligerent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>bellum</i>, for ""war."" You can use it to talk about actual wars — the nations taking part in a war are called <i>belligerents</i> — but usually <i>belligerent</i> describes a psychological disposition. If you're running a school for aggressive boys, do plenty of arts and crafts to prevent them from becoming too belligerent. The stress is on the second syllable: bə-LIJ-ə-rənt."

Bemoan,"Some people love to complain, don't they? Complainers also tend to <i>bemoan</i> things, which can be translated to ""Oh no! Why me?""<br><br>A more casual expression for <i>bemoan</i> is to moan and groan. If you step in a puddle and get your shoes wet, you might moan and groan about, or bemoan, your bad luck to whoever will listen. Just about any bad or annoying thing can be bemoaned. In fact, people love to bemoan how much other people are moaning and groaning about things!"
Berate,"A strong verb for harshly cutting someone down with words is <i>berate.</i> ""He didn't just correct the cashier who gave him the wrong change, he started to <i>berate</i> her, calling her names in front of the whole store.""<br><br>When you <i>berate</i> someone it is more than just raising your voice at them; it implies putting them down by insulting their character. <i>Berate</i> comes from the 16th-century English and French for ""to scold"" or ""to blame."" Often the anger behind the scolding seems over-the-top, as in ""When the young man behind the counter dropped the scoop of vanilla, the manager <i>berated</i> him excessively by declaring him worthless and weak."""
Beset,"<i>Beset</i> means to attack from all sides––an invading army will <i>beset</i> a castle, or you might find yourself <i>beset</i> by a devastating storm.<br><br><i>Beset</i> also has a very different meaning: to decorate or encrust with jewels or other ornamentation. If you are attending a ball, you may choose a gown that is beset with silver sequins, just be careful that you don't end up looking like a giant disco ball."
Bestow,"When you present an honor or gift to someone, you <i>bestow</i> it, which is the same as giving it, but often classier and more respectful.<br><br><i>Bestow</i> comes from the Middle English <i>stowen,</i> ""to place."" Placing something really valuable or honoring in the hands of another, or conferring a position of responsibility on them, is to bestow it. For example, ""She gave her teacher a ceramic apple she had made, knowing that her whole class would <i>bestow</i> the big honor of Teacher of the Year later that day,"" or, ""The king praised her for working with the poor, and he would later <i>bestow</i> the medal of honor on her in a ceremony."""
Bicker,"When you <i>bicker</i>, you argue in a petty way, like two kids squabbling in the backseat on a long car trip, or politicians taking cheap shots at each other but avoiding discussion of important issues.<br><br>It's impossible to <i>bicker</i> in a dignified way, as the word always suggests pettiness and an unpleasant experience for anyone within earshot. If, for instance, you've listened for years to your ill-tempered aunt from Boise <i>bicker</i> with your uncle from Dubuque over how the Thanksgiving turkey should be carved, you might want to book a trip to Tierra del Fuego and avoid the holiday altogether."
Bifurcation,"<i>Bifurcation</i> is a process in which something splits in two.<br><br><i>Bifurcation</i> is a word that sounds fancy but has a very simple meaning: splitting or cutting in two. If a stream divides into two smaller streams, that's a bifurcation. If you split a company into two divisions, that's a bifurcation too. This word can also refer to the exact spot where one thing splits into two. Since <i>bi</i> means two in many words, such as <i>bimonthly</i>, that's a good reminder of what bifurcation means."
Bipartite,"Anything <i>bipartite</i> has two parts or features. A <i>bipartite</i> agreement has two elements.<br><br>Words starting with <i>bi</i> usually involve two things, and that's the very definition of this word: things that have two parts are bipartite. It's often used (in botany, for example) to describe two-part things joined at the base, like leaves. An animal’s hoof that has two halves is bipartite. For abstract things, the word usually suggests entirely separate parts forming a single thing: bipartite agreements/rules/legislatures. If something has three parts instead of two, it's <i>tripartite</i>."
Blatant,"Something <i>blatant</i> is very obvious and offensive. Don't get caught in a <i>blatant</i> lie, because you won't be able to weasel your way out of it.<br><br><i>Blatant</i> acts are done without trying to hide them. This adjective is probably from Latin <i>blaterare</i> ""to chatter, croak"" or Latin <i>blatīre</i> ""to chatter, gossip."" A near synonym is <i>flagrant</i>."
Bleary,"Something that's <i>bleary</i> is dull, tired, or unfocused. Your eyes might be too <i>bleary</i> first thing in the morning to focus on the newspaper — at least before you've had a cup of coffee.<br><br><i>Bleary</i> almost always describes a person's eyes, although you can also use it simply to mean blurred or exhausted. A day spent traveling from Asia to North America can leave you with bleary eyes, and so can a night of crying after the death of your beloved dog. The word <i>bleary</i> comes from a now-obsolete adjective, <i>blear</i>, ""watery or rheumy,"" which may share a root with the German <i>blerre</i>, ""having blurred vision."""
Blight 1.,"A <i>blight</i> is a disease that hurts plants and makes their leaves wither. It can also affect neighborhoods. Urban <i>blight</i> refers to a part of the city where things are falling apart.<br><br><i>Blight</i> rhymes with bright, but it’s the opposite of sunshine; instead of making plants grow, it cripples them. The Irish Potato Famine was an example of a <i>blight</i>. In 1845, more than a third of the potato crops were ruined. The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You might want to think of it this way: a <i>blight</i> makes people — or plants — fight for their lives."

Bludgeon 1.,"As a noun, a <i>bludgeon</i> refers to a heavy club used as a weapon. Synonyms for <i>bludgeon</i> include truncheon, nightstick, cudgel, and billy club.<br><br>The verb <i>bludgeon</i> developed from the noun form. It means to strike repeatedly with a heavy club or similar weapon. If you have a cockroach invasion in your kitchen, you might be tempted to bludgeon the insects with a rolled up newspaper every time you turn on the lights. The verb <i>bludgeon</i> is also used metaphorically to mean to roughly coerce or force someone to do something as if you had a <i>bludgeon</i>. If your boss is a bully, he may bludgeon you and the other employees into working long hours for little recognition."
Blunder 1.,"A <i>blunder</i> is an embarrassing mistake. Accidentally called your new boyfriend by your old boyfriend's name? Ouch. That's a <i>blunder</i> you don't want to repeat.<br><br>Has an embarrassing mistake ever made you feel like you’re stumbling around with your eyes closed? If so, it won’t surprise you to learn that <i>blunder</i> comes from the Old Norse word <i>blundra</i>, meaning to “shut one's eyes.” It wasn’t until the eighteenth century that <i>blunder</i> came to refer to a stupid or embarrassing mistake, or as a verb, to describe making such a mistake, as in “I tend to blunder when I'm nervous.”"
Bode,"The verb <i>bode</i> suggests forecasting. Something <i>bodes</i> well when the clues or signs imply a favorable outcome. But if something <i>bodes</i> ill, you’d better watch out!<br><br>Something might bode good fortune, or it could bode disaster. The word, which can be traced back to the Old English <i>bodian</i> ""to announce, foretell,"" is also found in the adjective <i>foreboding</i>, which means ""ominous, boding ill."""
Boondoggle 1.,"A <i>boondoggle</i> is a useless, trivial piece of work — it's a waste of time. If you're serious about your career, you should avoid <i>boondoggles</i>.<br><br><i>Boondoggle</i> is a silly sounding word for a silly project. Any endeavor that's a total waste of time or has no value could be called a boondoggle, especially if you're doing it just to look busy and important. The verb <i>boondoggle</i> means to do that useless work. If the mayor spends all his time promoting an eagle reserve in the middle of the Bronx instead of focusing on subway repairs, you could call that a boondoggle."
Boorish,"If your cousin tells revolting jokes, belches, and smells like he spent the winter in a cave, he could be described as <i>boorish</i> — an adjective used for people with bad manners and a sloppy appearance.<br><br>We almost always use the word <i>boorish</i> for men. This may be because it can be traced back to a 13th century word for “herdsman.” Herdsmen spent a lot of time alone with their sheep, sleeping in tents, and cooking over open fires, so it was no wonder that they didn't have the same refined manners as city folk. If someone offends you by acting boorishly — say, by cutting you off in traffic — you could exclaim, “What a <i>boor</i>!”  Just don't confuse <i>boor</i> with <i>bore</i>: bad manners may be offensive, but they're rarely boring."
Booty,"<i>Booty</i> is treasure — money, jewels, and the like — obtained by criminal means, especially plundering or pillaging. If you're in the Caribbean on vacation, you could spend some time looking for buried pirate <i>booty</i>.<br><br>Although <i>booty</i> originally meant stolen goods from war or pirating activities, the term is now sometimes used more generically to mean any riches or treasure. Although you may feel as though you plundered your own bank account to buy new clothes for yourself, all the booty you brought home from the mall might make you decide that it was worth it."
Botch 1.,"If you <i>botch</i> something, you make a mess of it or you ruin it. If you totally <i>botch</i> your lines in the school play, you stammer and stutter your way through the whole thing.<br><br>Interestingly, the word <i>botch</i> originally meant the opposite of what it means today. The Middle English word <i>bocchen</i> meant to mend or repair. As a noun <i>botch</i> means an embarrassing mistake or something that is done poorly, especially due to lack of skill. If they've never painted before, your friends working on set design might make a complete botch of the scenery for the play, which might involve repainting the whole thing."
Boudoir,"<i>Boudoir</i> is a slightly old-fashioned word for a bedroom. You could invite a friend for a sleepover and say, ""You can sleep on the spare bed in my <i>boudoir</i>.""<br><br>These days, the word <i>boudoir</i> is mainly used for its humorous effect. You may also come across it in an old book or movie, almost always referring to a woman's private bedroom. A boudoir is comfortable and luxurious, and the word itself was popular among the upper class in the 18th century, from the French and meaning ""pouting room,"" from <i>bouder</i>, ""to pout"" or ""to sulk."""
Bout,"A <i>bout</i> is a fight. If you want to be a boxer, start with some easy <i>bouts</i> before challenging the champ.<br><br>A <i>bout</i> is a period of time in which something intense happens, like fighting, binging, or being sick, and comes from the word for bending, or going round in a circle. We usually use it these days for something you wouldn't want to go on for too long of a time. If the full moon makes you crazy, you might suffer a bout of madness."
Brawny,"Someone <i>brawny</i> is bulky and muscular. Most football players are <i>brawny</i>.<br><br>Brawn refers to muscles and physical strength: people often contrast brains and brawn. Therefore, if someone is brawny, they have large muscles and are quite strong. Many athletes are brawny, especially ones such as weightlifters and football players. Tennis players and jockeys are usually smaller and not so brawny. A brawny person is big, strong, rugged, and tough. If you'd like to be brawnier, go to the gym."
Bridle,"When you're riding a horse and scream ""Whoa!"" to make it stop, you're pulling on the reins, which are attached to a thing called the <i>bridle</i>, the buckled straps around a horse's head that help you control its movements.<br><br>The word <i>bridle</i> comes from the Old English <i>bridel</i> meaning ""rein, curb, restraint,"" which is precisely what the purpose of a bridle is — to help restrain a horse's movements when necessary. You can bridle a horse, which is the act of putting a bridle on it. If you yank too hard on the reins, your horse might bridle, or take offense to your aggressiveness, just like you might bridle if someone insulted you."
Buffoon,"A <i>buffoon</i> is someone whose ridiculous behavior is a source of amusement to others. People you might call a <i>buffoon</i> are a political rival or the guy at work who tells silly jokes at office parties.<br><br>The noun <i>buffoon</i> has changed its spelling over the years, but not really its meaning. In Middle French, it was <i>bouffon</i>, which came from the Italian <i>buffone</i>, meaning ""jester."" The original root is the Latin <i>buffare</i>. Think of the stereotypical court jester, the person who makes jokes and falls about trying to make the king laugh — he's paid to be a buffoon."
Bulbous,"Something that's <i>bulbous</i> is round or bulging. If you hit your head on the edge of your locker, you may end up with a tender, <i>bulbous</i> lump.<br><br>While anything that has the shape of a bulb — like an onion or a light bulb — can be described as <i>bulbous</i>, it almost always describes someone's nose. It's not very nice to tell your friend he has a bulbous nose, though it may be accurate. You can also call a plant <i>bulbous</i> if it's grown from a bulb. This is the earliest, 16th century use of the word, while the ""bulb-shaped"" meaning came along about 200 years later."
Bungle 1.,"Saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, dropping something, tripping and falling: these are some classic <i>bungles</i> — and they’re always embarrassing.<br><br>Bungles are bummers, it’s true.  Ever said something awkward in front of a grandparent or dropped a cake on someone’s lap?  Those are bungles — accidents that make you blush. <i>Bungle</i> can also be used as a verb when someone acts like a fool or simply messes everything up, as in “The teacher <i>bungled</i> her lecture because she left her notes at home,” or “My <i>bungling</i> dad fell into the punch bowl.  Again.”"
Buoyancy,"<i>Buoyancy</i> is a quality that makes things float in water. It's also a type of happiness: if you're full of <i>buoyancy</i>, your mood is light and happy.<br><br>This is a word with two main meanings that fit together well: Both kinds of <i>buoyancy</i> have to do with floating and staying up. The physical kind refers to objects that float instead of sinking in water, like a life raft or a <i>buoy</i>. The other kind of buoyancy is a happy mood, a feeling that nothing can get you down. So whenever you run into the word <i>buoyancy</i>, just think ""staying afloat."""
Buoyant,"Something that is <i>buoyant</i> floats in water. Since floating is happier than sinking, <i>buoyant</i> also refers to things are fun and upbeat.<br><br>Someone with a buoyant personality is fun to be around, laughs a lot, smiles, and cheers other people up. Buoyant people are lively and lighthearted — the opposite of sad, depressed, and bummed out. Buoyant people are also called <i>bubbly</i> and <i>cheerful</i>, and it should help to remember that buoyant objects float — just like a buoyant person can seem like they're floating too (as in the expression ""floating on air"")."
Burgeon,"Use the verb <i>burgeon</i> to describe something that is growing, expanding, and flourishing. If you have a green thumb, in the spring your flower gardens may <i>burgeon</i>. If you don't have a green thumb, your collection of plastic plants may burgeon.<br><br>Although <i>burgeon</i> means to grow and flourish, it doesn't necessarily have to apply only to plants. Your town can have burgeoning downtown development. Your tiny retirement account can burgeon into an excellent emergency fund if you invest even a small amount each month. You may have a burgeoning career as a villain if you overthrow a planet by using your mind-controlling ray gun on the populace."
Burly,"The adjective <i>burly</i> describes someone (usually male) who is muscular and beefy. Types of people that you might describe as <i>burly</i>? Football players, wrestlers, and bouncers at nightclubs.<br><br>The word <i>burly</i> is a synonym for words like <i>husky</i>, <i>brawny</i>, and <i>muscular</i>. The differences between the words can be subtle. Although they can all describe someone with beefy muscles, people tend not to think of <i>burly</i> as describing someone who has a lean, athletic muscular build. <i>Burly</i> is more often used to describe the guy that has a massive, muscular build, where his muscle may be tending toward fat."
Bygone,"The adjective <i>bygone</i> is good for describing long-ago times. Your grandparents might enjoy looking at old photo albums and reminiscing about <i>bygone</i> days.<br><br>A bygone era happened in the distant past, and a bygone sweetheart is an early romantic interest remembered by someone who's since lived a long life. You're most likely to see the phrase ""<i>bygone</i> days"" being used in a nostalgic way. If someone says, ""Let <i>bygones</i> be <i>bygones</i>,"" they want to make up for long-ago slights and arguments, leaving them in the past where they belong."
Calamity,"Use the word <i>calamity</i> to describe an event that causes great harm and misery, or a general state of distress or misery: the <i>calamity</i> of war.<br><br>Near synonyms are <i>catastrophe</i> and <i>disaster</i>. The noun <i>calamity</i> is from Middle English <i>calamytey,</i> from Latin <i>calamitas,</i> a word which might be related to Latin <i>clades</i> ""destruction."" Calamity Jane was the nickname of a 19th-century woman living on the U.S. frontier. She claimed to have some very exciting adventures."
Caldera,"A <i>caldera</i> is a crater formed after the eruption of a volcano. The <i>caldera</i> is formed when the volcano collapses into itself.<br><br>Volcanoes are impressive forces of nature with the power to wreak enormous destruction when they erupt. One sign of that power is a caldera, which is a crater formed after a volcano has erupted and collapsed into itself. Some of the more ancient calderas formed mountains and valleys in the Rockies and elsewhere. A related word in English is <i>cauldron</i>, whose modern meaning (a vessel for hot liquids) can remind us of the molten lava of a volcano."
Callous,"A <i>callous</i> person is insensitive or emotionally hardened. If you laugh at your little sister while she's trying to show you her poetry, you're being <i>callous</i>.<br><br><i>Callous</i> comes from the Latin root <i>callum</i> for hard skin.  If you walk barefoot a lot, your feet will become calloused. We usually use <i>callous</i> in the metaphorical sense for emotionally hardened. If someone is unmoved by other people's problems, you might say he shows a callous indifference to human suffering."
Calumny,"Use the noun <i>calumny</i> to characterize verbal attacks that are meant to destroy reputations or friendships. You've probably seen political ads during election time that rely on <i>calumny</i> to move voters.<br><br><i>Calumny</i> comes from the Latin word <i>calvi</i>, meaning ""to trick, deceive,"" which is why it can also describe falsely accusing someone or quoting them out of context with the intent to do them harm. Some political candidates use this tactic against opponents in the hope that voters will be tricked into thinking that the accusations are true."
Candor,"<i>Candor</i> usually means the quality of being open, honest, and sincere. If someone tells you they think you are dumb, you might reply with, ""While I appreciate your <i>candor</i>, I don't think we need to be friends anymore.""<br><br>The corresponding adjective is <i>candid</i>, as in ""I want you to be <i>candid</i>. Do these pants make me look fat?"" <i>Candor</i> is from French <i>candeur,</i> from Latin <i>candor,</i> from <i>candēre</i> ""to shine, be white."" The color white is associated with purity, which is a now obsolete meaning of <i>candor</i>."
Cantankerous,"If someone is <i>cantankerous</i> he has a difficult disposition. Take care not to throw your ball into the yard of the <i>cantankerous</i> old man down the street — he'll cuss you out and keep your ball.<br><br>The origin of <i>cantankerous</i> is unclear (it may be at least partly from Middle English <i>contek</i> 'dissension'), but ever since it first appeared in plays from the 1770s, it's been a popular way to describe someone who is quarrelsome and disagreeable. It is usually applied to people, but stubborn animals like mules are also described as cantankerous. Events can be cantankerous too, like a cantankerous debate. Some synonyms are <i>cranky, bad-tempered, irritable, irascible</i>."
Capitulation,"<i>Capitulation</i> is the act of surrendering or giving up. If you enter a pie eating contest when you're already full, you'll probably have to end up in a state of <i>capitulation</i>.<br><br>The original meaning of <i>capitulation</i> is ""the formal terms of surrender between governments."" The word comes from the Latin <i>capitulāre</i>, with a root in <i>capital</i>, or ""the head of state."" You can use <i>capitulation</i> for any act of surrender. If you're stuck in an endless argument with your neighbor over the exact boundary between your properties, only the original deeds to the land will bring about a capitulation."
Capricious,"<i>Capricious</i> is an adjective to describe a person or thing that's impulsive and unpredictable, like a bride who suddenly leaves her groom standing at the wedding altar.<br><br>You can criticize a fickle-minded person as <i>capricious</i>, but it could just as well describe quickly changing weather, as in ""<i>capricious</i> spring storms."" It's the adjective form of the noun <i>caprice</i>, which means a sudden change of mood. <i>Caprice</i> might come from <i>capra</i>, the Italian word for ""goat"" (because goats are frisky), or from <i>capo</i>, ""head"" + <i>riccio</i>, ""hedgehog."" Why bring hedgehogs into it? If you have a ""hedgehog head,"" you are so scared that your hair is standing straight on end. A scared person makes sudden starts this way and that, just as a capricious person does."
Carapace,"<i>Carapace</i> is a scientific term for protective shell. Turtles and crabs have them, but humans don't — so we make do with bike helmets and elbow pads.<br><br>Otherwise known as outerwear for arthropods and turtles, <i>carapace</i> is a word you probably won't come across very often, unless you're a zoologist. But that doesn't mean you can't use it to describe someone who's a tough nut to crack. If a person has a gruff attitude meant to protect them emotionally, they've certainly enclosed themselves in a carapace of sorts."
Cater,"To <i>cater</i> means to supply food for meetings or celebrations. If you're having a big barbecue party but would rather hang out with your friends than grill, you could pay someone to <i>cater</i> it.<br><br>In Middle English, the food supply in a big household was known as the <i>cates</i>, and so to <i>cater</i> meant keeping the pantry full. These days, caterers don't do pantries. They cook food for many different households or offices. <i>Cater</i> has also come to mean ""giving what is desired or needed."" You might cater to your grandfather by bringing him tea, reading to him, and laughing at his bad jokes."
Caveat,"A <i>caveat</i> is a warning. When someone adds a <i>caveat</i> to something they’re telling you to beware — maybe what they’re telling you comes with certain conditions or maybe there’s something dangerous lurking.<br><br>When your new friend gives you directions to her house, and then says, “The caveat is that when it snows the driveway turns into an ice rink,” she's warning you that your travels could be dangerous. <i>Caveat</i> is also a legal term for when a lawyer asks for a break in proceedings. If a lawyer issues a caveat, she's filing a formal notice to suspend a trial until her client gets a hearing."
Cede,"To <i>cede</i> is to give up or surrender land, position, or authority. ""She reluctantly <i>ceded</i> the coveted position as the baby of the family to her brother when he was born.  She would not, however, <i>cede</i> her bedroom to him.""<br><br><i>Cede</i> is a word often used in discussing diplomatic issues.  It is more commonly used in reference to actual physical things, like geographic areas or objects, but can also be used in reference to attitudes or opinions. ""The rebels <i>ceded</i> territory after the siege failed."" ""Dad tried but finally <i>ceded</i> control and let me have my own Facebook account."""
Cenotaph,"A <i>cenotaph</i> is a monument to the dead, specifically those buried in another place. <i>Cenotaphs</i> are often erected in honor of war veterans.<br><br>A cenotaph — which is very similar to a tomb — is a memorial to the dead. Unlike a tomb, a cenotaph doesn’t contain the body of the person memorialized, because the remains are elsewhere or couldn’t be recovered. Across the United States, you can find cenotaphs for people who served in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts. Family members and other citizens leave flowers at cenotaphs to pay respect to the dead."
Cessation,"<i>Cessation</i> is an end to something, such as the stopping of a bad habit, like the <i>cessation</i> of smoking.<br><br><i>Cessation</i> and <i>cease</i> sound alike and have similar meanings because they both come from the Latin word <i>cessare</i>, which means ""to delay, to stop.""  The <i>cessation</i> can be permanent, such as when the protests resulted in the <i>cessation</i> of the use of baby bunnies to test lipsticks (forever ending the bunny torture); or temporary, such as the <i>cessation</i> of the rain during the storm that let us run to the car without getting wet (but rain, like sunshine, always comes back)."
Chastise,"<i>Chastise</i> is a fancy word for telling someone that something they did was really bad. If you pick your nose, your mom will probably yell at you. If you pick your nose in front of the Queen of England, your mom will <i>chastise</i> you.<br><br>Back in the Middle Ages, <i>chastise</i> used to also come with a beating––that sense of the word has passed, and in fact, people tend to use <i>chastise</i> when they are trying to accuse someone else of overreacting. ""You're <i>chastising</i> me for forgetting to feed the cat, but it's not like the cat died!"""
Chauffeur,"Do you pay someone to drive you around? Then you have a private <i>chauffeur</i>.<br><br><i>Chauffeur</i> literally means ""operator of a steam engine"" in French, but they used it as a nickname for the first motorists who drove steam engine cars. Today chauffeurs are just the guys you pay to drive you around, like the chauffeur of a limo. <i>Chauffeur</i> can also be used as a verb: once you get your driver's license, your parents will be happy to not have to chauffeur you back and forth to school."
Cherub,"You might think of a rosy-faced child as a <i>cherub</i>, conjuring up an image of chubby, naked angels cavorting amongst the clouds. That image comes from the most familiar use of the word, which was to name an order of angels.<br><br>The image we have of a <i>cherub</i>, chubby-cheeked babies with wings, actually wasn't around until the Renaissance, when artists depicted the lower-order angels as children. Prior to that, the word evolved from the Hebrew <i>kĕrūḇ</i>, and was taken from the Aramaic <i>kĕ-raḇyā</i> which meant ""child-like."" It was this translation that encouraged the idea of a cherub as being portrayed as a child. The plural form, ""cherubim"" also follows the Hebrew grammar rule of creating plurals by adding the suffix <i>-im</i>."
Chord,"In music, a <i>chord</i> is three or more notes that combine harmoniously. You can play <i>chords</i> on a piano or guitar, but not on an instrument that plays one note at a time, like a trumpet.<br><br><i>Chord</i> comes from the French word for agreement, <i>accord</i>, so in music it means sounds that go together, or agree with each other. You can also use <i>chord</i> figuratively. If a book ""strikes a chord"" with you, you feel connected to it. In math, a <i>chord</i> is the straight line that connects two points on a curve."
Circuitous,"<i>Circuitous</i> means indirect or roundabout. If you're in a hurry to get to the hospital where your wife is having a baby, you want to take the straightest, fastest way, not a <i>circuitous</i> one!<br><br><i>Circuitous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>circuitus</i> meaning basically ""a going around."" If you're being <i>circuitous</i> it's like you're going around and around in circles. It can also refer to someone's manner or speech, if they are not being direct. For example, if you want someone to get you another piece of cake but just you sit there looking longingly at your empty plate, saying ""More cake sure would be nice,"" then you're being <i>circuitous</i>. And annoying."
Circumlocution,"<i>Circumlocution</i> is a long, complicated word which means a long, complicated way of expressing something. To cut to the chase, <i>circumlocution</i> means to beat around the bush.<br><br><i>Circumlocution</i> comes from the Latin words <i>circum</i>, ""circle,"" and <i>loqui</i>, ""to speak."" So circumlocution is speaking in circles, going round and round in a wordy way without ever getting to the heart of the matter. It's an evasive style of argument, best employed when you really don't want to say what's on your mind."
Clam,"A <i>clam</i> is a marine animal with two shells that eats by straining food from water, sand, or mud. You can sometimes find <i>clams</i> by digging in the sand close to the seashore.<br><br>The largest clams are used for food by humans, including the scallop, a particularly big form of clam. When you order soup in New England, it's not unlikely that it will be clam chowder, a creamy, thick stew with potatoes and pieces of clam. When <i>clam</i> is a verb, it means ""to dig <i>clams</i> on the beach,"" and if your friend offers to pay you 1000 <i>clams</i> for your old car, she means ""dollars."""
Clavicle,"The <i>clavicle,</i> more commonly known as the collarbone, connects your shoulder blade to you sternum.<br><br>The clavicle is the only long horizontal bone in the body (all the other long bones are vertical, such as those in the arms and legs). It evolved to provide a structural support for the arms, and also to serve as protection around blood vessels and nerves in that part of the body. The clavicles of birds are Y-shaped and, on a holiday turkey, are also called the ""wishbone."""
Clique,"A <i>clique</i> is an exclusive group of people or friends. Before Rudolph pulled Santa's sled through the fog, the <i>clique</i> of flying reindeer never let him play their reindeer games.<br><br>In high school, the exclusive nature of cliques causes a lot of hurt feelings. <i>Clique</i> carries this less than nice feeling with it wherever it goes, whether it be a set of elites who surround a government official, a group of popular kids who don't let others join their group or the closed circle of people at the office who always make sure they get the best jobs."
Clobber,"To <i>clobber</i> is to beat up or to defeat soundly in a game. You can say your favorite baseball team <i>clobbers</i> the competition if they win with a score of 10 to 0.<br><br>When a boxer knocks out his adversary he clobbers him, and a bully clobbers his victim by punching him repeatedly. You can also clobber someone without shedding blood, as when you beat your dad in chess. The word <i>clobber</i> was originally World War II British air force slang, in the 1940s, and usually referred to aerial bombing."
Clout,"When you speak of someone having <i>clout</i>, it usually means that they communicate a sense of power or influence, particularly in the political sense. ""You’ll wanna talk to that big guy over there if you want me to let you in. He’s got <i>clout</i>.""<br><br><i>Clout</i> can also mean to hit someone really hard — either the hit you give (“that’s a big <i>clout</i> he just landed”) or the act of hitting (“she <i>clouted</i> him with a baseball bat”). Of course, the sense of having power and the actual hitting are related, since clout is something to be wielded — either physically or figuratively. Note: it's not just tough guys who have clout. China is said to have ""growing economic <i>clout</i>,"" and Oprah is known to have significant <i>clout</i> in the media industry."
Clump,"A <i>clump</i> is a ""bunch"" or a ""cluster."" If you're a gardener, the last thing you want to see is a <i>clump</i> of weeds growing in the middle of your newly groomed lawn.<br><br>Essentially, a <i>clump</i> is a grouping. You might see a clump of sheep grazing in a field or you might throw a clump of clothes into the washing machine. <i>Clump</i> can also mean <i>lump</i>, like when you find a clump of grass stuck to your shoe. As a verb, <i>clump</i> means ""to gather,"" as in ""a flock of birds <i>clumped</i> together in a tree."""
Clutch,"To <i>clutch</i> is to grasp or hold on to tightly. Some people <i>clutch</i> the safety bar on the roller coaster for dear life; others throw their hands in the air.<br><br>As a noun, <i>clutch</i> has many meanings: a brood of chickens, a strapless purse, the extra pedal in a stick-shift car. But the verb remains a great way to describe grasping. ""Once I knew only darkness and stillness . . . but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living,” said Helen Keller, recalling the moment she learned to read Braille."
Coalesce,"Waiting for a plan to come together? You're waiting for it to <i>coalesce</i>. <i>Coalesce</i> is when different elements of something join together and become one.<br><br>In <i>coalesce</i>, you see <i>co-</i>, which should tell you the word means ""together."" The other half of the word comes from <i>alescere</i>, a Latin verb meaning ""to grow up."" So if you are trying to start up a photography club at school, once you have an advisor, some interested students and support from the administration, things will be coalescing or growing together. Another way to remember that? An adolescent is one who is growing. A lot!"
Coercive,"If you use <i>coercive</i> measures to get people to join your club, it means that you intimidate or force people to make them feel like they have to join.<br><br>If you use threats to get what you want from other people, your methods can be described as <i>coercive</i>. It can take nothing more than a strong sense of authority to come across as coercive, or the intimidation can take the form of physical threats. When you're coercive, you're demanding obedience without much concern for what the people you coerce need or want. The Latin root is <i>coercere</i>, which means ""to control or restrain."""
Collateral,"It's what you promise to give someone if you don't repay a loan, like the car you put up as <i>collateral</i> when you take a loan out from the bank. As an adjective, <i>collateral</i> can refer to something indirect or off to the side, like <i>collateral</i> damage.<br><br><i>Collateral</i> is the watch you put on the table in a poker game, or the shoes you trade in at the bowling alley. If you pay back your debts, you get your goods back.  As an adjective, <i>collateral</i> describes something indirect, like <i>collateral</i> damage (non-soldiers inadvertently killed in war) or <i>collateral</i> relatives such as your second-cousin-once-removed that your mother keeps bugging you to call."
Commensurate,"The word <i>commensurate</i> has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a <i>commensurate</i> punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.<br><br>When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison — that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word <i>commensurate</i> is usually followed by <i>with</i> or <i>to</i>; one thing is commensurate with or to another."
Commodious,"If your house has a big and comfortable living room, you could say that you have a <i>commodious</i> space for entertaining. <i>Commodious</i> means roomy.<br><br>Yes, you see the word, commode — i.e. toilet — in <i>commodious</i>. Both words once had the meaning of convenience attached to them from their Latin roots. Indoor plumbing is in fact convenient when you compare it with the alternative as is having room to spare. But that meaning was left behind years ago."
Compel,"<i>Compel</i> means to force or drive someone to do something. Even if you don't like toast, when you visit the toast-eating natives of Shrintakook Island, you'll be <i>compelled</i> to eat it, or they will not trust you.<br><br>You don't want to be compelled to go to a classical music concert if you'd rather listen to rap. School officials might be upset if a winter storm compels them to cancel classes, but you'd be okay with that. A <i>compelling</i> mystery forces you to pay attention because you want to find out ""whodunit."""
Comport,"<i>Comport</i> means to behave, and particularly to behave well. If you attend a school for social etiquette, you will learn how to <i>comport</i> yourself properly at the dinner table.<br><br>You’ll usually find <i>comport</i> in one of two phrases: with yourself, himself, etc., as in, ""With all that burping, you did not <i>comport yourself</i> well at Aunt Edna’s party,"" or with the word <i>with</i>. When you see the second version, <i>comport</i> means something more like agree. For example, you could say, ""I don’t think your ripped jeans and beat up t-shirt really <i>comport</i> with the guidelines for Casual Friday."""
Compunction,"When you feel <i>compunction</i> you feel very, very sorry, usually for something you did to hurt someone or mess something up. When you feel no <i>compunction</i>, you're not at all sorry.<br><br>The noun <i>compunction</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>compungere</i>, meaning “prick sharply.” When you feel <i>compunction</i>, you feel a sharp prick of your conscience. The word <i>compunction</i> is often used in the negative in phrases like “without compunction” or ""no compunction."" You might say that the burglar acted without compunction when he stole your baseball card collection."
Concave,"<i>Concave</i> describes an inward curve; its opposite, <i>convex</i>, describes a curve that bulges outward. They are used to describe gentle, subtle curves, like the kinds found in mirrors or lenses.<br><br>A valley is a <i>concave</i> curve, a mountain is a <i>convex</i> curve—you can remember this by thinking that things that vex you tend to stick out, and that caves tend to be holes that go in, like valleys or innie belly buttons. If you want to describe a bowl, you might say there is a large blue spot on the center of the <i>concave</i> side."
Concoct,"When you <i>concoct</i> something, you mix up different ingredients. If you want to become a mad scientist or a wizard, you'll have to learn how to <i>concoct</i> strange potions.<br><br>If the word <i>concoction</i> makes you think of steaming caldrons or liquids bubbling in test tubes, you’ll be amused to know that it comes from a Latin word for “digestion.” Yum!   On summer days, children sometimes concoct imaginative stews from grass, leaves and dirt. They may also concoct lies to explain why they tried feeding such concoctions to their little sister."
Concur,"To <i>concur</i> is to agree or approve of something. If someone says something you agree with, you can say ""I <i>concur</i>!""<br><br>Like many words with <i>con</i>, <i>concur</i> has to do with agreement and being together. When you concur, you agree with someone about something or let them know you approve. ""I concur"" is a formal (and sometimes humorous) way of saying ""I agree!"" or ""I hear that!"" Also, two events that happen at the same time can be said to concur. People are happy when good things concur, like when a birthday and nice weather happen at the same time."
Concussion 1.,"A <i>concussion</i> is a violent blow, especially to the head, that often injures the brain or causes a loss of consciousness — an all-too-frequent occurrence, unfortunately, in contact sports like football or boxing.<br><br>First used around 1400, <i>concussion</i> originates from the Latin <i>concussionem,</i> which means ""a shaking."" Your brain certainly gets ""a shaking"" when you take a heavy blow to the head, which sometimes causes injury or permanent damage. It's not just people, though, who get concussions; a building can also suffer from a concussion during an earthquake."
Condemn,"You can <i>condemn</i>, or openly criticize, someone who is behaving inappropriately. If you are an animal rights activist, you would probably <i>condemn</i> someone for wearing fur.<br><br><i>Condemn</i> originally comes, through Old French, from the Latin word <i>condemnāre</i>, ""to sentence, condemn."" You may see politicians condemn each other in political ads during a campaign in hopes of improving their chances of winning an election. You also might hear of a convict being ""<i>condemned</i> to death."" In this sense of the word, to <i>condemn</i> still carries on its Latin meaning of ""to sentence."""
Condescending,"If you are being <i>condescending</i>, you are looking down on someone. A 10-year-old who says to his sibling, ""What do you know? You're only a 6-year-old!"" is being condescending.<br><br>The Latin prefix <i>con-</i> means ""with,"" and the Latin word for <i>descend</i> means ""down,"" so the word <i>condescending</i> probably developed to describe someone who looked down on others. Condescending behavior is, not surprisingly, itself looked down upon. It's usually intended to make people feel bad about not knowing or having something, and it very often works."
Condone,"If you <i>condone</i> something, you allow it, approve of it, or at least can live with it. Some teachers <i>condone</i> chewing gum, and some don't.<br><br>Things that are condoned are allowed, even if everyone isn't exactly thrilled about it. People often say, ""I don't <i>condone</i> what he did, but I understand it."" Condoning is like excusing something. People seem to talk more about things they don't condone than things they do condone. Your mom might say, ""I don't <i>condone</i> you staying up till 10, but I know you need to read."" That's a way of giving approval and not giving approval at the same time."
Confer,"If you gab, chat, and talk it up with someone, you have conversation, but if you're looking for input from each other as you talk, you <i>confer,</i> or consult, together. They had a family meeting to confer about a schedule for sharing the new laptop.<br><br>Many uses of the verb <i>confer</i> involve consulting with another person or as a group. <i>Confer</i> has a second use meaning ""bestow,"" which means to award or hand over something. You can confer a medal on a winner or hero, or you can confer status through a promotion or assignment. Each year the teacher would confer the special honor of summer hamster-sitter on one responsible student."
Conflate,"<i>Conflate</i> is a more formal way to say ""mix together."" You probably wouldn't say you <i>conflated</i> the ingredients for a cake, but if you blended two different stories together to make a new one, <i>conflate</i> would work.<br><br>The verb <i>conflate</i> comes to us from the Latin word <i>conflare</i>, which literally means ""to blow together."" So think of using this word when you want to talk about two things getting thrown together and combined. Things that have been conflated often seem mixed up or confused, as when you conflate two different ideas, taking parts of one and parts of another to build your own Frankenstein version of things."
Confound,"If you have an identical twin, you've probably tried dressing alike so that people <i>confound</i> you with, or mistake you for, one another. You've also probably learned that, unfortunately, this trick doesn’t work on your mom.<br><br>The verb <i>confound</i> means both ""to mistake"" and ""to confuse."" If you decide to treat yourself to a delicious dessert, you might find yourself confounded by the overwhelming number of choices. If you end up ordering the chocolate cake but the waiter brings you chocolate mousse, the waiter has somehow confounded those two options. Another meaning you may come across in literature is ""to damn,"" as in ""<i>Confound</i> it! You are the most exasperating person on the planet."""
Congenial,"A <i>congenial</i> person is  easy to get along with. If you're trying to decide which of your friends to take on a road trip, choose the most <i>congenial</i> one.<br><br><i>Congenial</i> means sharing the same temperament, or agreeing with your temperament.  You can talk about a congenial person, place, or environment. Maybe you enjoy the congenial atmosphere of the library. Or perhaps for you the disco is more congenial.  As you might expect for such a vaguely approving word, there are many synonyms: <i>agreeable, pleasant, delectable, delightful, enjoyable,</i> and so on."
Conjecture,"Can you guess what <i>conjecture</i> means? It's a word to use when you are not sure of something and have to ""guess or surmise.""<br><br>You can see how the word <i>conjecture</i> means that you create a theory or opinion about something without basing it in fact because the original definition of <i>conjecture</i>, from Old French, is ""interpretation of signs and omens."" Since signs and omens are pretty subjective, it makes sense that the word would then move to its current meaning. However, even though it only seems like weather reports are <i>conjectures</i>, they are actually based on evidence!"
Connoisseur,"A <i>connoisseur</i> is a person who, through study and interest, has a fine appreciation for something, like the <i>connoisseur</i> who can identify the clarinet player on a jazz recording by the sound of his inhalations alone.<br><br>A connoisseur is an authority in his field, someone who has expert knowledge and training, especially in the arts. A <i>connoisseur</i> may also be someone with an extremely developed sense of taste, like the connoisseur who can identify rare wine by a flavor others can't even detect. Then again, some people call themselves connoisseurs of just about anything they like — pizza, old vinyl albums, even cartoons — because they know so much about it."
Consignment,"<i>Consignment</i> means the delivery of things, like clothing or furniture, for sale or donation to someone else. A ""<i>consignment</i> shop"" is a clothing store that sells other people's clothing and goods.<br><br><i>Consignment</i> is a commercial term that refers to a giving over of objects. If your goods are <i>on consignment</i>, you still technically own them while they are on sale at the consignment shop. The word sometimes refers literally to goods being delivered or shipped, such as food or cargo. <i>Consignment</i> can also mean entrusting a person into the care of someone else, as when you put your aging grandparents in an old-aged home."
Consort,"If you keep company with someone, you are <i>consorting</i> with them. ""The students tended to <i>consort</i> only with other students from similar backgrounds. The staff wanted to break them out of their comfort zone, so they organized games to force them to mingle and meet new people.""<br><br><i>Consort</i> is usually followed by the preposition <i>with</i>, and sometimes the verb <i>consort</i> is followed by the phrase ""with the enemy."" The military frowns on <i>consorting</i> with the enemy in a war. Her best friend accused her of <i>consorting</i> with the enemy when she walked home with another girl. As a noun, the term <i>consort</i> refers to the spouse of the reigning monarch. Prince Albert was called the prince <i>consort</i> because he was married to Queen Victoria when she ruled Great Britain."
Consternation,"<i>Consternation</i> is a noun that can stop you in your tracks because it means ""a sudden, alarming amazement or dread that results in utter confusion; dismay.""<br><br>If you have a sense of <i>consternation</i> you have become afraid, disoriented, or completely befuddled. It comes from the Latin roots <i>con</i>- and -<i>sternare</i>, which means ""spread out."" Picture all of your thoughts strewn about, nothing makes sense and you might experience a state of <i>consternation</i>. Like the nightmare about the class you forgot to go to in high school and now you have to take the final exam!"
Consummate,"<i>Consummate</i> means complete, finished, or masterful. If you refer to someone as a <i>consummate</i> chef, then you are saying he is the ultimate chef. If you say someone is a <i>consummate</i> jerk, then you are saying he is the ultimate jerk.<br><br><i>Consummate</i> can be used to describe something good or bad: <i>consummate</i> joy, a <i>consummate</i> liar. To <i>consummate</i> means to bring something to completion, but it often refers specifically to making a marriage complete by having sexual relations. The adjective is pronounced KÄN-sə-mit, but the verb is pronounced KÄN-sə-māt."
Contemptible,"Someone or something that's <i>contemptible</i> receives harsh judgment and deserves it.  Your desire to bring to justice the <i>contemptible</i> coward who stole your last chocolate bar seemed noble, until you realized you'd eaten it the night before.<br><br><i>Contemptible</i> means ""worthy of contempt,"" and is one of several words of its kind that end with <i>-ible</i> rather than <i>-able</i>, which would mean something more like ""capable of contempt,"" (and isn't a word). You could remember that “I find it contemptible!” begins with “I.”  If you don't, some will consider your spelling errors to be minor offenses, while others will declare them . . . contemptible!"
Contend,"To defend a belief or keep affirming that it's true is to <i>contend</i>. People used to contend that the earth was flat, but eventually, when no one dropped off the edge no matter how far they traveled, the ""round"" theory won.<br><br>One of the meanings of <i>contend</i> is from the French ""to strive with,"" and it is a literal fighting, as in ""to contend with fists."" Most contemporary uses of the verb <i>contend</i> illustrate competitions of proof or defense, where a person will contend that something is true, or better, or wrong. It is still a striving but more of a verbal kind, where what you contend is what you hope to convince others is correct."
Contortion,"If you twist your body into a <i>contortion</i>, you might put one leg behind your ear, and clasp your arms behind your back. A <i>contortion</i> is a twisted position.<br><br>Yoga can feel like a series of contortions to beginners. People who twist their bodies into contortions professionally are called contortionists. In order to become a contortionist, you need to start with a lot of flexibility and a willingness to contort your body into uncomfortable positions. You then need a lot of practice. It is not easy to achieve a perfectly freakish contortion."
Conundrum,"The tricky word <i>conundrum</i> is used to describe a riddle or puzzle, sometimes including a play on words or pun.<br><br>One of the most famous <i>conundrums</i> is the riddle of the Sphinx, famously in the play <i>Oedipus the King</i> by Sophocles. Oedipus encounters the Sphinx, a mythical beast, who asks him, ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?"" The answer is ""A person"": crawling as a child, walking as an adult, and using a cane in old age. The scary thing is that if the Sphinx asked you the riddle and you didn't know, she'd eat you!"
Convalesce,"<i>Convalesce</i> is a soft-sounding word, and it describes something you should do in a soft bed: recover from an illness.<br><br>When someone is convalescing, you can be sure something bad happened to them. Maybe they were hit by a car, had a heart attack, or got a bad case of the flu. People convalesce in hospitals, or, if things are a little less serious, at home. A nursing home is sometimes called a ""<i>convalescent</i> home,"" because the old people who live there often have health problems. When you're sick or hurt badly enough to be convalescing, the good news is that you're starting to heal and have time to catch up on books or TV."
Coquette,"A <i>coquette</i> is a flirt, a girl or woman who knows how to flatter and manipulate men with her charms in order to get what she wants.<br><br><i>Coquette</i> sounds French, and it is, borrowed into English from French in the mid-17th century. It's the feminine diminutive form of <i>coq</i>, which means ""cock, a male bird"" — so <i>coquette</i> refers to a little female bird, and, in fact, it's also the name of a kind of colorful hummingbird found in Latin America. If you imagine a <i>coquette</i> as a flamboyant little bird flitting about and teasing the male birds, you'll have a good picture of a <i>coquette</i>."
Cordial 1.,"If you like someone but you wouldn't say they're your friend, you might describe your relationship as <i>cordial</i>. Use <i>cordial</i> to describe a greeting or relationship that is friendly and sincere.<br><br>In Middle English, this adjective meant ""of the heart,"" borrowed from Medieval Latin <i>cordiālis</i>, from Latin <i>cor</i> ""heart."" This core sense of ""heart"" can be seen in the synonyms <i>heartfelt</i> and <i>hearty</i>. The noun <i>cordial</i> originally referred to a medicine or drink that stimulates the heart, but its current sense is ""a liqueur."""
Cordial 2.,"If you like someone but you wouldn't say they're your friend, you might describe your relationship as <i>cordial</i>. Use <i>cordial</i> to describe a greeting or relationship that is friendly and sincere.<br><br>In Middle English, this adjective meant ""of the heart,"" borrowed from Medieval Latin <i>cordiālis</i>, from Latin <i>cor</i> ""heart."" This core sense of ""heart"" can be seen in the synonyms <i>heartfelt</i> and <i>hearty</i>. The noun <i>cordial</i> originally referred to a medicine or drink that stimulates the heart, but its current sense is ""a liqueur."""
Cornucopia,"A grocery store with a large selection of fruits and vegetables could be said to have a <i>cornucopia</i> of produce. A <i>cornucopia</i> is a lot of good stuff.<br><br>Around Thanksgiving in the United States, you'll often see cornucopias or horn-shaped baskets filled with fruit and other goodies as centerpieces. Originally, a cornucopia was a goat's horn filled with corn and fruit to symbolize plenty. Nowadays, a cornucopia is probably made of some kind of plaster or wicker, but it still symbolizes the same thing — a good harvest season."
Corrosive,"A <i>corrosive</i> substance, like hydrochloric acid, will eat away most things on which it is spilled. Watch out in chemistry lab: you wouldn't want to destroy your homework, desk, or worse, your own skin by spilling something <i>corrosive</i> on it.<br><br>The word <i>corrosive</i> comes from the Latin word, <i>corrodere</i>, meaning ""to gnaw away."" <i>Rodere</i> (to gnaw) is the same root word for <i>rodent</i>, so you can remember the word <i>corrosive</i> because something that is corrosive gnaws through things like a rodent. The adjective <i>corrosive</i> is also used to describe something that is bitingly or spitefully sarcastic. If you're known for your corrosive wit, you probably don't win any popularity contests."
Cot,"A <i>cot</i> is a small, portable bed. You might sleep on a <i>cot</i> when you go camping.<br><br>Some hotels offer cots for extra guests who stay in your room, and campers and soldiers on the move often use cots for sleeping. A cot's benefits include its light weight and ability to be folded into an easily carried size. In Britain, a <i>cot</i> is a baby bed or crib. <i>Cot</i> has a Hindi source, <i>khat</i>, ""couch, bed, or hammock"" from the Sanskrit <i>khatva</i>."
Countenance,"The noun <i>countenance</i> means the face or its expression. If you're a great poker player, you probably have a calm <i>countenance</i>.<br><br><i>Countenance</i> comes from a French word for ""behavior,"" but it has become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face itself: ""He had a puzzled countenance,"" or ""what a charming countenance!""<i>Countenance</i> can also be a verb meaning to tolerate or approve. If someone does something offensive, tell them, ""I'm afraid I can't countenance that."""
Crag,"A <i>crag</i> is a rough, jagged section of rock. Some sections of the Maine coast are made up of rugged <i>crags</i> and rocky beaches.<br><br>Steep rock faces and cliffs are covered with crags — if you're a rock climber, you might attempt to scale the crags of a jagged rocky mountain. Parts of northern England and Scotland are particularly famous for their crags, and in fact the root of the word <i>crag</i> is Celtic, related to the Old Irish <i>crec</i>, ""rock,"" and the Welsh <i>craig</i>. ""rock"" or ""stone."""
Cranial,"Something that's <i>cranial</i> has to do with your skull. A severe <i>cranial</i> injury requires testing to make sure you don't have a concussion.<br><br>Your <i>cranium</i> is your skull — the hard bone that encloses and protects your brain. Things that are <i>cranial</i> are connected to this part of your body — the cranial space is the area inside your skull, and cranial nerves are connected to your brain. The Greek root of both <i>cranium</i> and <i>cranial</i> is <i>kranion</i>, ""skull"" or ""upper part of the head."""
Creed,"Without reading the long document about the group's beliefs — its <i>creed</i> — he knew he didn't fit in, because he just couldn't bow to the 12-foot statue of a rabbit, no matter what it symbolized.<br><br>A <i>creed</i> can be a formal doctrine, or system of beliefs, for a church or religious group, or it can be a philosophy, or personal set of beliefs. The origins of the word are in the Latin <i>crēdō,</i> ""I believe,"" once specific to the Christian faith, but by the 17th century it was used for many different faiths. Companies, societies, and disciplines might also adopt a creed — as in a political creed, a national creed, or a management creed — that lays out a particular belief-system or way of doing things."
Crepe,"A <i>crepe</i> is a thin, French of pancake. It's also a word for a type of thin, crinkly paper. Don't confuse your <i>crepes</i> and start chewing on paper.<br><br>Both types of crepes are thin, though there's only one kind you'd want to eat. The inedible crepe is paper that's very thin and crinkly. Crepe paper is usually colored and is often used in decorations. The other type of crepe is a thin pancake that is filled with many types of food, including meat and fruit. Crepes are even thinner than Swedish pancakes, and they're either sweet or savory. This word shares a linguistic ancestor with English's <i>crisp</i>."
Cringe,"When you <i>cringe</i>, your body language shows you don't like what you see and hear. You close your eyes and grimace. You may even jerk your body away from the offensive sight or sound, like the old picture of you in an ""awkward stage"" that makes you <i>cringe</i> whenever you see it.<br><br>Whether it's a song you hate or someone mentioning an embarrassing moment from the past, you <i>cringe</i> at things that are unpleasant. If you think about the way your body involuntarily flinches or bends in those situations, you won’t be surprised to learn that the word <i>cringe</i> can be traced back to the Old English word <i>cringan</i>, meaning “give way, fall (in battle), become bent.” That’s exactly what your body does when you <i>cringe</i>!"
Crone,"The haggard old woman who lives down the street in a ramshackle house, shaking her fist while chasing children out of her yard? You might call her a <i>crone</i>, if you’re brave. (But be careful: the term is insulting.)<br><br>Since the late fourteenth century the word <i>crone</i> has been a term of abuse describing old and bad-tempered women. It traces back to the Anglo-French word <i>charoine</i>, meaning “dead flesh.” Most people don’t like being described as dead flesh, and if the person happens to have a bad temper also . . . well, you can see that it’s not a term you want to toss around lightly. You’re more likely to hear it used in a Shakespeare play than in real life."
Croon,"To <i>croon</i> is to sing a soft or emotional song. A father might <i>croon</i> a lullaby to his baby as she falls asleep. Elvis Presley was known to <i>croon</i> to the ladies.<br><br>The verb <i>croon</i> is originally a Scottish word, from the Middle Dutch root <i>kronen</i>, ""to lament or mourn."" When you croon, you hum or sing in a soft, low voice, like your heart is breaking. You might croon to your child or sweetheart, or maybe you croon in the shower. In the 1930s and 40s, a ""crooner"" was a singer who was known for specializing in sentimental jazz songs."
Culvert,"A <i>culvert</i> is a drain — but not of the kinds that drain your bathtub or empties your bank account. A <i>culvert</i> is any kind of channel or tunnel that directs unwanted water away from roads and other corridors of travel.<br><br>A <i>culvert</i> is typically built underground to prevent inconveniently located streams and rain runoff from flooding roads, highways, streets, and railroads. <i>Culvert</i> can also be used as a verb: if water pools in your driveway and then seeps into the foundation of your house, soaking the brand-new carpet in the basement that you thought you’d just waterproofed, you might wonder why the builders didn’t culvert that underground stream."
Curb,"The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get the car close enough to the <i>curb</i> without hitting it. A <i>curb</i> is the edge of the sidewalk beside the road.<br><br>When you're using the word <i>curb</i> as a noun, it's the raised edging beside a street. When <i>curb</i> is a verb, it means to restrain or hold back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly acted play. <i>Curb</i> comes from the Latin word for ""curve,"" <i>curvus</i>, which describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head — in the fifteenth century, this band was called a curb."
Curfew,"<i>Curfew</i> is a rule or law that sets a time that certain people have to be off the streets. A town may set a <i>curfew</i> for teenagers, for example, although many parents impose a stricter <i>curfew</i> for their own kids.<br><br>Historically, a curfew was signaled by the ringing of a bell meant to alert residents that it was time to put out their hearth fires. The word <i>curfew</i> comes from an Old French word <i>cuevrefeu</i>, ""cover fire,"" <i>cuevre</i> meaning to cover, and <i>feu</i> meaning fire. Over time, <i>curfew</i> has come to refer to getting people off the streets at night and into their homes, often during times of civil unrest."
Curry,"<i>Curry</i> is a South Asian-style dish of vegetables or meat in a very flavorful, spicy sauce. You can try many types of <i>curry</i> in an Indian restaurant.<br><br>There are different curries from different parts of Asia — a Thai curry, for example, might consist of shrimp and vegetables in a rich yellow sauce. When <i>curry</i> is a verb, it can mean ""make <i>curry</i>,"" but it's more commonly ""groom a horse."" A <i>curry</i> comb, in fact, is specially made for this purpose. This <i>curry</i> comes from the Anglo-French <i>curreier</i>, ""to comb a horse,"" while the dish has a Tamil root, <i>kari</i>, ""sauce."""
Daft,"<i>Daft</i> means ""foolish, wacky, or nutty."" like your <i>daft</i> idea of wearing flip-flops to hike through the snow so that you didn't ruin your boots.<br><br>When the adjective <i>daft</i> is used, you know something extremely silly or obviously goofy is involved — like setting all your money on fire to keep warm, instead of just using it to buy a coat. Some synonyms for <i>daft</i> are <i>absurd</i>, <i>ridiculous</i>, <i>senseless</i> and <i>idiotic</i>, so if someone calls you ""daft,"" maybe you should rethink what you are trying to accomplish: Is there a better way to do it?"
Dander,"<i>Dander</i> is an animal's tiny flakes of skin. People who are allergic to cats are typically sensitive to their <i>dander</i>.<br><br>Furry animals shed both hair and microscopic dander — and it's more common to be allergic to the dander. If you have dog allergies, your body overreacts to breathing in the dander of your best friend's chihuahua, making you sneeze. Another kind of <i>dander</i> is an angry or frustrated feeling, which shows up in the phrase ""get your <i>dander</i> up."" You might say, ""My <i>dander</i> was up from the minute he made that offensive joke."""
Darn 1.,"To <i>darn</i> is to stitch up a small hole in a piece of clothing. Instead of throwing your worn-out socks away, you can just <i>darn</i> the holes in their toes.<br><br>When you darn your socks or sweaters, you use a needle and thread to close small holes in the woven fabric. There's even a specific stitch known as a ""darning stitch,"" in which you first weave the thread with the grain of the fabric, and then fill in the other ""woven"" direction. The result is a sturdy patch made only of thread. <i>Darn</i> comes from the Middle French <i>darner</i>, ""mend."""
Darn 2.,"To <i>darn</i> is to stitch up a small hole in a piece of clothing. Instead of throwing your worn-out socks away, you can just <i>darn</i> the holes in their toes.<br><br>When you darn your socks or sweaters, you use a needle and thread to close small holes in the woven fabric. There's even a specific stitch known as a ""darning stitch,"" in which you first weave the thread with the grain of the fabric, and then fill in the other ""woven"" direction. The result is a sturdy patch made only of thread. <i>Darn</i> comes from the Middle French <i>darner</i>, ""mend."""
Debase,"To <i>debase</i> something is to make it corrupt or impure. If your lemonade stand sells “pure lemonade,” you’d insist on using real lemons instead of a mix; using a mix would <i>debase</i> your product.<br><br><i>Debase</i> is often used in the context of two things: coins and people. To debase a coin is to replace some of the precious metal in the coin with metal of lesser value. To debase a person is to corrupt them, often by driving them to perform an immoral act like (gasp!) using the lemonade mix. Just promise us you won’t do it."
Debauchery,"<i>Debauchery</i> is a noun meaning crazy partying and wild nights, usually accompanied by a lot of alcohol. So you probably don't want to engage in any kind of <i>debauchery</i> the night before an exam.<br><br><i>Debauchery</i> is all about indulging in some of life's pleasures — overindulging, in fact. It stems from the Middle French word <i>debaucher</i>, which means to “entice from work or duty.” So imagine workers being tempted from another day at the office by the promise of a wild bender in Vegas. Or college kids putting down the books and heeding the siren call of the frat party downstairs."
Debunk,"When you <i>debunk</i> something you show it to be false. Many magicians, including Houdini and Penn and Teller, have worked to <i>debunk</i> the idea that magic is anything other than a very clever illusion.<br><br>To <i>debunk</i> something is to prove it wrong. The idea that music education is frivolous and should be the first item cut from the budget is something that music teachers word hard to debunk — in fact, they've done it by proving that students perform better in schools with strong music programs. The verb <i>debunk</i> was first used by an American writer, William Woodward, in 1923, to mean ""take the bunk out of something."" Bunk means ""nonsense."""
Decadent,"If your friend vacations in lavish hotels, wears thousand-dollar shoes, and refuses to eat cheese that costs less than $20 an ounce, you might say her lifestyle is <i>decadent.</i><br><br>A <i>decadent</i> is a person who has fallen into a state of moral or artistic decay. Typically, though, we use <i>decadent</i> as an adjective to describe wasteful indulgence or extravagance. Celebrities who find themselves unable to manage sudden fame and fortune sometimes go overboard, throwing million-dollar parties, living the fast life, turning to drugs and alcohol. And because they're famous, we read about them and their decadent lifestyles in the tabloid papers."
Decree,"Look carefully! A <i>decree</i> isn't something you get when you graduate. That one little letter change makes it something else altogether: a legally binding command or the announcement of such a thing.<br><br>If you go back far enough, a <i>decree</i> referred to a decision handed down by the Roman emperor. In more modern usage, a divorce decree is the document issued by a court that terminates a marriage. And if you want to go out with someone on a date, but things keep preventing you from having the chance to ask, you could say that fate did not decree it to be so."
Decrepit,"That building falling down on the corner of your block? It's <i>decrepit</i>. So is the old man who lives there, if he is weak from age. <i>Decrepit</i> means broken down by hard use.<br><br><i>Decrepit</i> implies that something or someone is a weak, and run down — practically falling apart. It's really not a nice word to use about a person. If you are trying to say the same thing about a person, but more nicely, you might use the word, feeble, which means weak, but not disastrously falling apart."
Deign,"<i>Deign</i> means to reluctantly agree to do something you consider beneath you. When threatened with the loss of her fortune, an heiress might <i>deign</i> to get a job, but she might look down her nose at the people she'd have to work with.<br><br><i>Deign</i> has the same origins as <i>dignity</i>. Both descend from the Latin word, <i>dignare</i>, meaning ""to deem worthy."" If you deign to do something, you don't feel it's worthy of your lofty stature, but you do it anyway — it's like you're doing someone a really big favor. Instead of admitting his wrongdoing, the politician who is accused of taking bribes might indignantly declare, ""I won't deign to dignify your ridiculous accusations with a response!"""
Delineate,"Though you pronounce it duh-LIN-ee-ate, there is a ""line"" in the middle of <i>delineate.</i> This might help you remember that to delineate is to out<i>line</i> and define something in detail or with an actual marking of <i>lines</i> and boundaries.<br><br>When you create an outline for a paper it usually summarizes what you will detail later. You delineate the sections, or mark the heading lines, and when you write the details, you delineate the subject of each heading. So, to delineate is both to mark lines and to fill in the lines. Using a fence to divide properties or a carpet to claim your side of the bedroom also is a way to delineate, or mark, physical boundaries."
Delinquent,"The adjective <i>delinquent</i> describes something that is past due or people who are negligent in doing their duty. If you are <i>delinquent</i> in paying your <i>delinquent</i> library fines, you won't be able to check out any more books.<br><br>You may have heard the term juvenile delinquent, which refers to a young (juvenile) person who gets in trouble, often with the law, but people of any age can be delinquent. A delinquent landlord is one who doesn't make repairs. A delinquent tenant is one who does not pay his rent."
Delude,"To <i>delude</i> is to trick or fool, often in relation to yourself. If you <i>delude</i> yourself into thinking your mom's chocolate cake is low in fat, you'll be disappointed to find out it's made with two sticks of butter!<br><br>If you delude someone into thinking something, you are making a fool of them, or making them foolish. The word shares a root with ludicrous which means completely ridiculous. The thing that you foolishly believe is a delusion. Someone with delusions of grandeur has deluded themselves into thinking they are very, very special."
Deluge,"Feeling overwhelmed, like you're underwater? You might be experiencing a <i>deluge</i> — like when you've been given a <i>deluge</i> of homework over vacation: a dozen term papers, two dozen books to read, and a mile-high stack of math problems.<br><br>The noun <i>deluge</i> is an overwhelming amount of something in general, such as work, people, or questions. Because of its Latin roots, however, in particular it means an overwhelming amount of water. It comes from <i>diluvian</i>, which means flood. The verb <i>deluge</i> similarly means to overwhelm or inundate with something, particularly water. The hurricane <i>deluged</i> the island with rain. A deluge isn't always a bad thing, however. One thing most people would like to be <i>deluged</i> with? Money."
Denizen,"A <i>denizen</i> is an inhabitant or frequenter of a particular place: a citizen of a country, a resident in a neighborhood, a maven of a museum, a regular at a bar, or, even, a plant that is naturalized in a region.<br><br>The noun <i>denizen</i> comes from words that mean “from” and “within” and is related to “citizen.”  <i>Denizen</i> can be used when talking about any person or group of people that have a specific relationship with a place. It was historically used to refer to foreigners who were either naturalized or becoming citizens but now it is used much more generally, as in: ""The <i>denizens</i> of my aunt’s neighborhood all have contracts with the same gardener."""
Denounce,"To <i>denounce</i> is to tattle, rat out, or speak out against something. When you stand on your desk and tell the class that your partner is cheating, you <i>denounce</i> him or her.<br><br>The prefix <i>de-</i> means ""down,"" as in <i>destroy</i> or <i>demolish</i> (tear down). Add that to the Latin root <i>nuntiare</i>, meaning ""announce,"" and <i>destroy</i> plus <i>announce</i> equals <i>denounce</i>. It's a word that shows up in the headlines often, as a country might <i>denounce</i> a corrupt election. Politicians love to <i>denounce</i> each other's shady doings, or <i>denounce</i> some underhanded activities of people in their party in order to separate themselves. <i>Denounce</i> can also mean the official end of something, like a treaty."
Denude,"When you <i>denude</i> something, you expose it by taking away what covers or protects it.  Loggers who clearcut forests <i>denude</i> them of all trees.<br><br>There are both natural and human-related ways to denude a piece of land or an area of the earth's surface. The erosion of sea water on the coast can denude beaches and coastlines, eroding and wearing them away. Pesticides used on large farms can denude entire regions of honey bees. The word comes from a Latin root, <i>denudare</i>, ""to lay bare, strip, or expose,"" from <i>de-</i>, ""away,"" and <i>nudare</i>, ""to strip."""
Deplore,"The verb <i>deplore</i> is used to express strong disapproval of something. If you really, really hate the way your mom makes meatloaf, then it's safe to say you <i>deplore</i> it.<br><br><i>Deplore</i> comes from Latin roots that mean to bewail or lament. So if you <i>deplore</i> something, you object to it because it brings you sorrow or grief. People often deplore things that they regret or feel bad about. You might deplore the inhumane treatment of animals or the deforestation of the Amazon. Or maybe you just deplore your wardrobe choices from middle school."
Derail,"When a train or a subway <i>derails</i>, its wheels accidentally leave the tracks. Train cars that <i>derail</i> can cause the cars behind them to crash.<br><br>Mistakes by engineers or flaws in the track can derail a train or trolley, sending it off the rails and sometimes injuring the passengers. You can also use the verb <i>derail</i> figuratively, to mean ""hinder someone"" or ""divert a process from going in its intended direction."" For example, terrorists might derail ongoing peace talks by blowing up a bus. The word comes from the French <i>dérailler</i>, ""go off the rails."""
Derelict,"If something has been abandoned, you can call it <i>derelict</i>. Even if a person has abandoned his responsibilities, you can say that he is <i>derelict</i> in his duties. But don't call a lost child <i>derelict</i> — unless, of course, he has neglected his chores.<br><br>As an adjective, <i>derelict</i> describes something that is rundown, neglected, or in deplorable condition, but the word can also mean ""negligent in duty."" The politician was so busy using his office for personal gain that he was derelict in his duty to the people who voted for him; he hadn't been present at a vote in months. As a noun, a <i>derelict</i> means a homeless person."
Deride,"The verb <i>deride</i> means to show a low opinion of someone or something. The jerk would deride the other kids on the bus by calling them names or pulling their hair until the driver decided to de-ride him by kicking him off the bus.<br><br>To ""ride"" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to <i>deride</i> is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. <i>Deride</i> comes from the Latin root <i>dērīdēre,</i> meaning ""to ridicule, to scorn,"" and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns."
Derision,"If people are laughing at you, making fun of you, and acting as if you're worthless, they're treating you with <i>derision</i>. <i>Derision</i> is mean and attacking — it's a form of contempt.<br><br><i>Derision</i> is more than just making fun of someone — it's mocking someone so forcefully and with such venom that you discredit the person completely. Derision can include literally laughing at someone or just treating a person like a joke. You know how celebrities and politicians do embarrassing things from time to time? They're usually treated with derision afterward: people mock them, treat them with contempt, and try to make the person who messed up seem completely worthless."
Derogatory,"Something that's <i>derogatory</i> is insulting or disrespectful. If you make <i>derogatory</i> comments, that means you say things that are unflattering, unkind, or demeaning.<br><br><i>Derogatory</i> means about the same as <i>insulting</i>. Derogatory language is meant to hurt, and it usually does. If you feel offended or insulted by what someone says, the person probably said something derogatory. Racial, sexist, and homophobic slurs are all derogatory. Insults that mean someone is stupid or crazy are derogatory. Making a joke about someone's mother is derogatory."
Desiccate,"The verb <i>desiccate</i> means to dry out, dry up and dehydrate. It's helpful to <i>desiccate</i> weeds but certainly not crops.<br><br>As anyone who's been stuck in the desert will tell you, being <i>desiccated</i> by the burning sun isn't much fun. Stemming from the Latin word <i>desiccare</i>, which means to ""dry up,"" <i>desiccate</i> also means to preserve something by drying it out. Without desiccation, raisins or beef jerky would not be possible!"
Desideratum,"A <i>desideratum</i> is something you desire or want. It's a fancy word for a must-have.<br><br>This official-sounding Latin word means something very common: anything you want or need. A new book could be a desideratum. A chocolate cake could be a desideratum. More commonly, a desideratum is something that is truly needed, like food or shelter. For many people, a happy marriage is a desideratum. For a politician, getting elected is a desideratum. You can almost see the word <i>desire</i> in <i>desideratum</i>, and that should help you remember it’s an object of desire."
Desist,"You can use the verb <i>desist</i> as a way to say ""stop"" or ""cease."" Instead of yelling ""Cut it out!"" the new neighbor asked the tween girls to desist from playing any more loud, screeching music from that long-haired boy-band.<br><br>If you want to insist that someone stop doing something, the word <i>desist</i> is a solid choice. It's often used as part of a legal order called a ""cease and desist,"" which forces an action to come to a halt. ""Cease"" is a synonym for <i>desist,</i> so using the two together says ""stop it!"" loud and clear — and kind of redundantly. ""If she will <i>desist</i> from camping on the lawn in front of the star's Hollywood home, she won’t be arrested."""
Detriment,"<i>Detriment</i> is the hurt or harm as a result of damage, loss, or a bad decision. The developers won the lawsuit, much to the <i>detriment</i> of the people who live near the construction site.<br><br>The meaning of <i>detriment</i> has not changed much from its roots in the Latin word, <i>detrimentum</i>, which is ""a rubbing off, loss, damage, defeat."" A <i>detriment</i> is a loss that wears you down. Smoking is a <i>detriment</i> to good health, as is standing in the snow barefooted. To the <i>detriment</i> of the people who clean the floors, we gave the girls scrambled eggs right before gymnastics class."
Detrimental,"<i>Detrimental</i> is a formal way of saying ""harmful."" Anything <i>detrimental</i> hurts, hinders, or puts a damper on something. <i>Detrimental</i> things do damage.<br><br>Have you ever heard ""Smoking may be <i>detrimental</i> to your health"" and wondered what it meant? It means that smoking is bad for your health: it's going to harm you in a bunch of ways. <i>Detrimental</i> is a more official, formal way of talking about things that do harm. A dog who likes digging holes can be detrimental to a garden. If you're writing a paper and want to pick an alternative to <i>harmful</i> that sounds more formal, <i>detrimental</i> is a great choice."
Detritus,"There aren't many things more depressing than walking on a beautiful beach and discovering a stretch of it that's covered in <i>detritus</i>. <i>Detritus</i> means trash or debris.<br><br>Usually, <i>detritus</i> refers to waste or junk of some kind, but it can actually mean any accumulation of material, not only man-made stuff. Loose gravel, silt, and sand can all be called detritus, and so can decomposed organic matter, like piles of dead leaves. The Latin word <i>detritus</i> literally means ""a wearing away."""
Devastate,"If a storm <i>devastates</i> your town, it comes pretty close to destroying it. To <i>devastate</i> is to cause destruction to or overwhelm.<br><br>Really bad news can devastate a person, or leave them devastated. They are so upset, they feel crushed. A basketball team can devastate an opponent by running roughshod over their defense. The root of the word is the Latin <i>vastare</i> which means to lay waste, which comes from <i>vastus</i> meaning desolate or empty. Imagine a city laid waste after a major earthquake and you've got the picture!"
Diction,"<i>Diction</i> is the way you talk, that is, the way you enunciate or pronounce your words, and the words and phrases you choose to use.<br><br>If you've seen the musical ""My Fair Lady,"" you know the character Eliza Doolittle struggles with her diction as her mentor tries to teach her to become a lady. Because of her accent, she has the most difficult time properly pronouncing even the most simple phrases, but in the end, she succeeds in saying things like the key phrase, ""The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."""
Dictum,"""You are what you eat"" is a <i>dictum</i>, and so is a law requiring you to curb your dog. A <i>dictum</i> is a formal pronouncement, a rule, or a statement that expresses a truth universally acknowledged.<br><br><i>Dictum</i> dates from the 16th Century. It descended from a Latin word that means ""something said."" In contemporary use, it means more like ""something that is officially said."" If the principal of your school issues a dictum declaring ""no jeans in school,"" it's time to go shopping."
Dignitary,"A <i>dignitary</i> is a very important person (VIP), usually from another country. Major <i>dignitaries</i> from other countries might get to meet the President when they visit the U.S.<br><br>If you see the word <i>dignity</i> in <i>dignitary</i>, it gives you a clue to its meaning. When we treat people with dignity, we're treating them with respect. Dignitaries get a lot of respect, because they're important and powerful people in their country — heads of state, ambassadors, and royalty are all dignitaries. It's not easy to become a dignitary: you'd better either be born into the right family or become a powerful person in some other way."
Digress,"If we're talking about science fiction, and you suddenly go off on a long tangent about the cost of grape soda, you <i>digress</i>. When a person <i>digresses</i>, they stray from the topic.<br><br>It's easy to understand why you digressed from the main topic. You were incredibly excited, speeding on caffeine, and, let's face it, you've never been at a loss for words. Don't get me wrong: I love your wanderings — how you drift from one topic to the next, letting your mind explore. The problem was that the meeting was running late and there was no time to let you digress. I had to pull you back to the main topic. I didn't want our potential new partners to get the idea that these digressions were typical."
Dilate,"To <i>dilate</i> something is to make it wider. When the light fades, the pupil of your eye will <i>dilate</i>, meaning it looks bigger.<br><br>The verb <i>dilate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>dilatare</i>, which means “enlarge” or “spread out.” When something stretches, expands, or becomes wider, it is said to dilate. Usually the word <i>dilate</i> is used when the opening of something circular becomes larger, but every so often you might hear someone refer to the need to dilate someone's understanding of quantum physics, global warming, livestock breeding, or any other topic."
Diligent,"Someone who is <i>diligent</i> works hard and carefully. If you want to write the epic history of your family, you'll have to be very diligent in tracking down and interviewing all of your relatives.<br><br><i>Diligent</i> comes from the Latin <i>diligere</i>, which means ""to value highly, take delight in,"" but in English it has always meant careful and hard-working. If you're a diligent worker, you don't just bang away at your job; you earnestly try to do everything right. Although being lucky and talented doesn't hurt, it's the diligent person who eventually succeeds."
Diminutive,"<i>Diminutive</i> means small. A <i>diminutive</i> person is short and small. A  <i>diminutive</i>  word is a ""cute"" version of a word or name:  for example, ""duckling"" is a  <i>diminutive</i>  of ""duck"" and Billy is a  <i>diminutive</i>  form of the name William.<br><br>A diminutive name or word is formed from another by the addition of a suffix expressing smallness in size: a <i>booklet</i> is a small book, a <i>dinette</i> is a small version of a dining set. The adjective <i>diminutive</i> descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Late Latin <i>dīminūtīvus</i>, from Latin <i>dēminuere</i> ""to lessen."""
Dingbat,"A <i>dingbat</i> is an idiot: a person who's dumb, silly, or just empty-headed.<br><br>There are a lot of insulting words for someone who isn't very smart: moron, dummy, knucklehead, bonehead, etc. Another is dingbat. A dingbat isn't simply dumb, but also ditzy. On the sitcom “All in the Family,” Archie Bunker often called his wife Edith a dingbat. This is an insult, but it's humorous and not that offensive. Dingbats are also characters or ornaments used in typesetting that don't have any meaning. Those dingbats are also a little silly."
Dingy,"If something is <i>dingy</i>, it's dirty. If you spend your days as a chimney sweeper, you probably look pretty <i>dingy</i>.<br><br>The adjective <i>dingy</i> is often, but not always, used to describe one's clothing or living space. The adjective <i>dingy</i> comes from uncertain origins, but experts suspect it may be a backformation from the word <i>dung</i>, which is animal excrement. So you can imagine how dirty, dismal, grungy, and grimy something described as <i>dingy</i> is."
Discursive,"If people accuse you of rambling from topic to topic in your speech or writing, they may say you have a <i>discursive</i> style — with changes in subject that are hard to follow. But it's okay because unicorns are shiny.<br><br>The adjective <i>discursive</i> is often used to describe speech or writing that tends to stray from the main point, but the word can also have almost the opposite meaning. <i>Discursive</i> can also be used to describe an argument based on reason instead of intuition: ""Her <i>discursive</i> dissertation on Colonial American women was well-argued and well-reasoned. Her professors were most impressed with her work."""
Disdain 1.,"If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may <i>disdain</i> it (or treat it with <i>disdain</i>).<br><br>In Old French, <i>deignier</i> meant ""to treat something as worthy."" To <i>dis</i>dain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: ""Management at [the company] displayed a certain <i>disdain</i> for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization."" As a verb, <i>disdain</i> carries an air of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like <i>despise, abhor, detest, loathe</i> and <i>scorn</i>. So if you disdain something, you might reject it with a haughty scoff, ""Ha!"""
Disdain 2.,"If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may <i>disdain</i> it (or treat it with <i>disdain</i>).<br><br>In Old French, <i>deignier</i> meant ""to treat something as worthy."" To <i>dis</i>dain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: ""Management at [the company] displayed a certain <i>disdain</i> for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization."" As a verb, <i>disdain</i> carries an air of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like <i>despise, abhor, detest, loathe</i> and <i>scorn</i>. So if you disdain something, you might reject it with a haughty scoff, ""Ha!"""
Disgorge,"There's really no way to put this delicately. <i>Disgorge</i> is just a fancy word for ""puke."" You know... ""Barf."" ""Spew."" ""Upchuck."" Usually applied to birds or animals rather than people.<br><br>Okay, actually that's not entirely true. <i>Disgorge</i> also has the other broader, metaphorical meanings of ""emptying out,"" as in: ""the bus began to <i>disgorge</i> its passengers;"" or ""he finally began to <i>disgorge</i> his secrets."" So, actually, yes, it does mean a lot more than just ""puke."" Sorry."
Dismantle,"To take something apart or down is to <i>dismantle</i> it. If you <i>dismantle</i> a computer to see what it looks like inside, you better know how to put it back together, or you might be looking at the inside of your room for awhile.<br><br><i>Dismantle</i> is a verb used for both physical things and ideas. You can dismantle a campground by taking down the tents and breaking apart the fire logs, or you can dismantle a government by going against its leadership and bringing down its rule. Often when you <i>dismantle</i> something, you take away its ability to work, as with a nuclear warhead, but you can also take apart decorative or non-working things, as when you dismantle a science-fair display or a city made of blocks."
Disparage,"If you haven't got anything nice to say, then it's time to <i>disparage</i> someone. It means to belittle or degrade a person or idea.<br><br><i>Disparage</i> is a specific way to describe a certain kind of insult, the kind that secures the insulter's place as superior. It often refers to an opinion or criticism lobbed in print or via word of mouth, not necessarily an act done to someone's face. If someone or something is being disparaged, you will often find a competing interest in the wings."
Disparaging,"When you are <i>disparaging</i>, you express negative, low opinions in order to lower someone's reputation. Your friend will probably not appreciate it if you make <i>disparaging</i> comments about his girlfriend.<br><br>In its original use, <i>disparage</i> meant ""to marry unequally,"" and it was considered a disgrace if a very wealthy son married, say, the kitchen maid. Nowadays we use <i>disparaging</i> for any derogatory or belittling expression or comment. If just won an Olympic gold medal, it's just rude and unnecessary to be disparaging about the silver medalist in an interview. Making disparaging remarks about your wife's cooking is unlikely to result in better food. She'll just get mad."
Dispense,"To <i>dispense</i> means to give out or distribute something. A school nurse can <i>dispense</i> students' medication and we all can <i>dispense</i> advice.<br><br>The word <i>dispense</i> comes from the Old French word <i>dispenser,</i> meaning ""give out."" You can dispense anything from hand sanitizer to dating advice. When <i>dispense</i> is paired with <i>with</i> it means ""get rid of it"" or ""skip."" If you dispense with traditional Thanksgiving dishes, you might instead celebrate with pizza, pancakes, tacos — anything but turkey and all the fixings."
Ditch,"A <i>ditch</i> is a long trench or pit dug into the ground. If your lawns are always soggy, build a drainage <i>ditch</i> for the excess water to flow into.<br><br>A ditch can be a man-made trench, usually long and narrow, dug into the earth, or a natural ditch made by flowing water. Originally used for farming, we now use <i>ditch</i> for any pit in the ground. <i>Ditch</i> can also be a verb meaning to toss something or forsake it. You can ditch a plan that's going wrong, or a boyfriend who is misbehaving. If you make an emergency crash landing, you ditch your plane."
Diverge,"When two roads <i>diverge</i>, they split and go in different directions. If your opinion <i>diverges</i> from mine, we do not agree. To <i>diverge</i> means to move apart or be separate.<br><br>The poet, Robert Frost, wrote: ""Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -/ I took the one less traveled by / And that has made all the difference."" The word <i>diverge</i> in the poem carries both the meaning of separating and of being apart from the main. As a poet, it was Frost's job to use words properly. Here he does not diverge from this role."
Divination,"The idea that you can see the future by supernatural means is called <i>divination</i>. When your friend tells your fortune by reading the tea leaves in your cup, she claims to have the power of <i>divination</i>.<br><br>The prediction or prophecy itself that's given through the act of fortune telling is also called <i>divination</i>. A psychic's divination that your aunt will soon start a family is much less impressive if your aunt is obviously pregnant. You can also use <i>divination</i> to refer to someone's unusual intuition, like a child who seems to know by divination when someone is feeling sad or upset."
Divulge,"If you've been sneaking around with your best friend's boyfriend, that's probably one secret you don't want to <i>divulge</i>, because revealing that tidbit of information will probably cut your friendship short.<br><br><i>Divulge</i> often precedes the word <i>secret,</i> because it means to reveal something, and that something is often of a personal or private nature. A gossip columnist's job is to divulge which celebrities are secretly dating and which ones have been caught in embarrassing situations. Although the word comes from the Latin word for making something public to the masses, it can also be used to describe information passed from one person to another. For example, a mother could divulge to her daughter that she was adopted."
Doable,"Something that's <i>doable</i> can be achieved or is possible. You might be certain your plan to ride your bike across the country is <i>doable</i>, while your friends and family aren't so sure.<br><br>Learning to speak a new language might feel impossible at first, but you'll soon realize it's doable, especially if you find people to practice speaking with. While keeping 200 cats in your house would be utterly unworkable, keeping two cats is completely doable. Though the adjective <i>doable</i> has been in use since the 15th century, today it's considered to be an informal word."
Dogged,"Someone who's <i>dogged</i> is stubbornly persistent. In the old Looney Tunes cartoons, Wile E. Coyote's pursuit of the Road Runner is <i>dogged</i>. He simply will not give up.<br><br>You can see the word <i>dog</i> within the word <i>dogged</i>. It's no trick. If you're dogged, you are as obstinate and tenacious as a dog who smells a bone. An earlier definition of this adjective was more general, meaning ""having the qualities of a dog."" Today, though, if someone describes you as <i>dogged</i>, they simply mean that you won't stop until you get what you want."
Doldrums,"<i>Doldrums</i> aren’t drums that you can play like the tom-toms. Rather people use this noun to describe a period of time that is boring, depressing, or characterized by inactivity.<br><br>The noun <i>doldrums</i> is derived from the word <i>dull</i>. If you’ve been vegging out in front of the TV for hours, bored out of your mind, you might say you’re ""in the <i>doldrums</i>."" This word is often used in phrases describing a slump in the economy or as in “the summer <i>doldrums</i>” to describe the hot, lazy days of summer."
Douche,"A <i>douche</i> is a type of hygiene product women use to clean their vaginas. <i>Douche</i> is also a common slang word for ""jerk"": the variation <i>douchebag</i> is extremely popular.<br><br>There’s no clear way to define what a <i>douche</i> is, though anyone acting arrogant, jerky, or nasty might be described as one. Since this is a slang word that some find disgusting and particularly offensive to women, be careful when using it. The d-word isn’t as bad as the f-word, but your mother or your teacher probably doesn’t want to hear about “That <i>douche</i> in my math class!” So it's probably best to keep your vocabulary <i>douche</i>-free."
Dour,"<i>Dour</i> describes something sullen, gloomy, or persistent. You might look <i>dour</i> on your way to picking up your last check from the job you just got fired from, and people should get out of your way.<br><br><i>Dour</i> and <i>endure</i> most likely come from the Latin word <i>durus</i> which means ""hard."" If something is hard to endure for a long enough time, it can make even the most happy-go-lucky person <i>dour</i>. <i>Dour</i> sounds like <i>sour</i> (or closer to ""do-er""). It's a tomato/tamahto word, but either way — if you're in a sour mood, you have no sense of humor, and you're <i>dour</i>."
Drab,"Dull, dreary, dingy, depressing: These adjectives capture the sense of <i>drab</i>, whether the word is used to describe a muted color, a miserable mood, or an oppressively boring existence.<br><br>Have you ever heard of the color olive drab? It's the color the military clothes its soldiers in and is the original meaning of the word <i>drab</i>. A little over 100 years ago, people began using <i>drab</i> in the metaphorical sense to mean ""dull"" and ""lacking brightness."" If a website or an advertisement is drab, the page is boring and unattractive. If it is cold and rainy for a week, you'll get awfully tired of those drab days, and a great teacher can make even the drabbest book come to life."
Dragnet,"If you suddenly start noticing police officers around every corner, you might be watching a <i>dragnet</i> in progress. A <i>dragnet</i> is a coordinated attempt to catch a criminal.<br><br><i>Dragnet</i> originally referred to a kind of net for catching fish. It can now also indicate a less literal type of net: one that catches crooks. Police may use a dragnet if they know a wanted criminal is in a certain neighborhood. When cops set up a dragnet, they may call in extra officers, fence off areas from civilians, and arm themselves heavily. This word became famous because of the TV show <i>Dragnet</i>, which featured Sergeant Joe Friday."
Dredge,"When a harbor becomes filled with silt, you <i>dredge</i> it to make it navigable again. You scoop out the mud with a big shovel, which is also called a <i>dredge,</i> and make a channel deep enough for ships.<br><br>Dredges have been at work in the Hudson River for years getting rid of industrial toxins, dredging up the contaminated sediment and loading it into barges to be carried away. If you've dropped your gold watch or your car rolled into a pond by mistake, there are dredges that can be dragged across the bottom to recover things that have fallen in. You can dredge up memories, too, which usually entails reminding people of unpleasant ones they’d rather forget."
Dregs,"Those little grains of tea or coffee left at the bottom of the cup are known as the <i>dregs</i>. The <i>dregs</i> are the least wanted portion, or the residue.<br><br>Literally speaking, <i>dregs</i> refers to sediment at the bottom of a liquid such as tea, but figuratively you can use <i>dregs</i> to mean “a small amount left.” If you are running out of food in your refrigerator, you might say, “We’re down to the <i>dregs</i> in here.” <i>Dregs</i> is also used in the same way as the expression “bottom of the barrel.” The “<i>dregs</i> of society,” for instance, is a negative phrase that describes people whom the speaker considers to be useless."
Drone,"To <i>drone</i> is to make a low, continuous noise that sounds like humming or buzzing. On summer nights, you might hear cicadas <i>drone</i>, and on snowy winter mornings, hear your neighbor's snow blower <i>drone</i>.<br><br>Like animals and machines, people drone too, their voices sounding dull and tedious: ""When my history teacher <i>drones</i> on, it's hard to stay awake."" <i>Drone</i> is also a noun, meaning the monotonous sound itself, like the drone of a boring lecture; or a male worker bee; or a person who's as unambitious as a worker bee. Finally, there are the drones that fly by remote control, doing surveillance, gathering weather information, and occasionally firing missiles for the military."
Eccentric,"You're most likely to encounter the adjective <i>eccentric</i> in a description of an unusual or quirky person — like a scatterbrained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat.<br><br>From the Greek <i>ekkentros</i>, ""out of the center,"" this word originally had to do with the orbits of planets that were observed to be slightly out of whack. Eventually it came to describe people who were a little kooky, both as an adjective and as a noun, too: <i>an eccentric</i> is an unconventional, odd person. Think of them as following a slightly different orbit from the rest of society."
Ecclesiastic,"If you’re an <i>ecclesiastic</i>, you probably spend a lot of time in church. The word <i>ecclesiastic</i> describes a member of the clergy, typically someone associated with a Christian church.<br><br>The word <i>ecclesiastic</i> has origins in the Greek word <i>ekklesiastes</i>, meaning ""speaker in an assembly or church,"" and can be used to describe someone associated with a church, such as a cleric or a priest. When you see an English word that begins with the <i>eccles</i> bit, you can be pretty sure that its meaning will somehow involve religious matters. That’s because <i>ekklēsia</i> is the Greek word for church and it has influenced the spelling of many English words of a religious nature, such as <i>ecclesial</i>, <i>ecclesiolatry</i>, and <i>ecclesiarch</i>."
Ecclesiastical,"Anything <i>ecclesiastical</i> is related to the Christian church. An <i>ecclesiastical</i> office is the office at a church, and a nun’s habit is <i> ecclesiastical</i> dress. A hat with a propeller on top is not.<br><br>Ecclesiastical things have to do with Christian churches or the clergy. Pews, readings from the Bible, and stained glass windows are all part of the ecclesiastical world. The ecclesiastical hierarchy is the pecking order of the clergy. If a politician gets support from a church, that's an ecclesiastical endorsement. If you believe in the separation of church and state, you definitely don't want ecclesiastical teachings to inform the way laws are made. <i>Secular</i> is the opposite of <i>ecclesiastical</i>."
Eclectic,"She listens to hip-hop, Gregorian chant, and folk music from the '60s. He's been seen wearing a handmade tuxedo jacket over a thrift-store flannel shirt. They both have <i>eclectic</i> tastes.<br><br>The English word <i>eclectic</i> first appeared in the seventeenth century to describe philosophers who did not belong to a particular school of thought, but instead assembled their doctrines by picking and choosing from a variety of philosophical systems. Today, the word can refer to any assemblage of varied parts. You can have an eclectic group of friends (friends from diverse groups), eclectic taste in furniture (a mixture of 18th-century French chairs, Andy Warhol paintings, and Persian rugs), or enjoy eclectic cuisine (fusion cooking that uses ingredients from different national cuisines)."
Eerie,"<i>Eerie</i> means spooky, creepy or suggestively supernatural. If it's <i>eerie</i>, it's sure to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.<br><br>Back in the 1300s when <i>eerie</i> first came on the scene, it meant ""fearful or timid."" It took a good 500 years or so before it morphed into the adjective we know today, which now means ""causing fear because of strangeness."" And the strangeness is key: Something that's eerie isn't just scary. It's mysterious, ghostly, and gives you the creeps. Like dark old castles, misty graveyards and creaky sounds in the middle of the night."
Efficacy,"The degree to which a method or medicine brings about a specific result is its <i>efficacy.</i> You might not like to eat it, but you can't question the <i>efficacy</i> of broccoli as a health benefit.<br><br><i>Efficacy</i> is a more formal way to say effectiveness, both of which stem from the Latin verb <i>efficere</i> ""to work out, accomplish."" The effectiveness, or efficacy, of something is how well it works or brings the results you hoped for. A scientist does research to determine the efficacy of a vaccine or medicine under development. If it is efficacious, it will cure or prevent a disease."
Effusive,"Getting a compliment from your <i>effusive</i> Aunt Sally can be a little embarrassing. Since she's so <i>effusive</i>, Aunt Sally holds nothing back, gushing with enthusiasm.<br><br>The adjective <i>effusive</i> means ""extravagantly demonstrative,"" and if you know someone who expresses positive emotions in a heartfelt, bubbly way, you understand just what the word means. The word <i>effusive</i> has a surprisingly similar definition in geology; it describes a particular kind of volcanic eruption, one in which lava bubbles up out of the volcano and flows around it."
Egregious,"Something that is <i>egregious</i> stands out, but not in a good way — it means ""really bad or offensive."" If you make an egregious error during a championship soccer match, your coach might bench you for the rest of the game.<br><br>""My massage therapist gave me bruises,"" someone complained recently on Twitter, asking, ""When does it cease to be deep tissue massage therapy and become <i>egregious</i> and unabashed manhandling?"" An <i>egregious</i> error is hardly forgivable. Some synonyms are <i>shocking, appalling,</i> and <i>intolerable</i>. The word has made a 180-degree turn from its original sense in Latin, when it meant ""exceptionally good."" Word historians have speculated that the negative usage was originally meant to be ironic, but it is the only sense that has survived. Be careful not to use it to mean ""outstanding,"" since no one wants to be called <i>egregious</i>."
Elated,"If you're <i>elated</i> you aren't just happy — you're over the moon, absolutely excited and bursting with pride. Like the way you feel after winning a scholarship to an Ivy league school or mastering a back handspring.<br><br>You might be elated to hear you got that dream job. That is, until you find out it doesn't come with any vacation days or health benefits. But don't let that dampen your elation. Feeling <i>Elated</i> is all about being so extremely proud and overjoyed, and usually happens as a result of an accomplishment. So if you've just achieved something big, feel free to be elated — and enjoy your time on cloud 9."
Eloquent,"When you're <i>eloquent</i>, you have a way with words. An <i>eloquent</i> speaker expresses herself clearly and powerfully. Even though <i>eloquent</i> usually describes oral speech, it can also be used to describe powerful writing.<br><br>Being eloquent is about using words well. All the great writers from English class — such as Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson, and Virginia Woolf — were eloquent. A great orator or speaker like Martin Luther King was eloquent. When something is beautifully, gorgeously, perfect said (or written), it's eloquent. Being eloquent requires your words to be smooth, clear, powerful, and interesting. To write or speak in an eloquent way takes a lot of work."
Elucidate,"If you <i>elucidate</i> something, you explain it very clearly. If you don't understand fractions, a visit to the pie shop may <i>elucidate</i> the subject for you.<br><br><i>Elucidate</i> is from Late Latin <i>elucidare,</i> from the Latin prefix <i>e-</i> ""thoroughly"" plus  <i>lucidus</i> ""clear, bright."" This Latin adjective is the source of English <i>lucid,</i> which describes someone who thinks clearly or something that is clear enough to understand."
Emblematic,"Something <i>emblematic</i> is symbolic. Empty buildings are <i>emblematic</i> of a city in decline, and a crown is <i>emblematic</i> of royalty.<br><br>If you know that an emblem is a visual symbol, then you won't be surprised that emblematic things stand for other things. In fact, the word <i>emblem</i> comes from the French word for <i>symbol</i>. Something emblematic represents a larger issue, good or bad. Sometimes <i>emblematic</i> is used for things that are excellent examples. An A student is an emblematic student, and a war hero is an emblematic soldier. Emblematic people are symbols of what others aspire to be."
Eminent,"Anyone highly regarded or prominent is <i>eminent</i>. <i>Eminent</i> people are very successful at their jobs. If you’ve heard of Neil deGrasse Tyson, it’s probably because he’s an <i>eminent</i> astrophysicist.<br><br>Every field has eminent — impressive, famous, or accomplished — people. Two of the most eminent coaches in the history of professional basketball are Red Auerbach and Phil Jackson because they've won the most championships. Beethoven was an eminent musician. Frank Lloyd Wright was an eminent architect. Eminent people loom over a field because they're influential and you can't avoid hearing about them. It's not easy to be eminent because you have to be extremely successful."
Enact,"You often hear that Congress is going to <i>enact</i> a new statute, which means that they will make it into a law. But <i>enact</i> also means to perform, like in a play. (Makes you wonder if the lawmakers are actors!)<br><br>Inside the word <i>enact</i> is that little word <i>act</i>, meaning “to do.” That makes sense, because when you enact something, you make it happen. And of course, we know that to act also means to perform, and so <i>enact</i> means “to act out,” like on stage.  Now that the new rules have been enacted, you'll have to stop wearing your gorilla suit to work.  Even after Labor Day."
Encircle,"To <i>encircle</i> is to surround, or to make a circle around. On the last night of summer camp, the counselors and campers traditionally <i>encircle</i> the campfire and sing songs.<br><br>Prisons are encircled by barbed wire fences, and hot, damp pavement encircles most public swimming pools. When you hug your little sister, you encircle her with your arms. If your tomato plants are growing too tall and flopping over, you should encircle them with twine to hold them up. <i>Encircle</i> adds the prefix <i>en-</i>, ""make or put in"" to <i>circle</i>, from its Latin root <i>circus</i>, or ""ring."""
Encroach,"To <i>encroach</i> is to overstep your bounds, to take over space or rights that belong to another, like your brother whose mess always <i>encroaches</i> on your side of the room you share.<br><br>The verb <i>encroach</i> comes from the Old French word <i>encrochier</i>, meaning “seize, fasten on, catch with a hook.” If people slowly take over what belongs to do, they encroach, like people who encroach on your personal space at a crowded concert, or someone whose questions get more and more personal, which encroaches on your privacy."
Endemic,"If you want to underscore just how commonly found and present something is within a particular place, try the word <i>endemic</i>. Tight pants are <i>endemic</i> in my lunch room!<br><br>Although <i>endemic</i> meaning ""prevalent"" often describes a plant or disease, it can also refer to something less tangible and more unwanted such as violence or poverty. Many complain of endemic corruption in the local government. Despite its <i>-ic</i> ending, <i>endemic</i> can also be used as a noun to signify a plant or animal that is prevalent in a certain region. If an endemic is brought to another area which it takes over, destroying the local population, it's classified as an invasive species. And researchers have cataloged several new African endemics."
Endow,"To <i>endow</i> is to furnish, but not with furniture. If you've been <i>endowed</i> with something, it means you've been given a gift — most likely a gift that can't be returned or exchanged, like a sense of humor or athletic ability or trust.<br><br>We usually use <i>endow</i> to refer to an ability or a quality, but you can endow someone with money, too. <i>Endow</i> is related to the word <i>dowry</i>, which is a gift that a man -– or sometimes a woman -– receives from his or her fiancé’s family before the wedding. The practice of giving dowries has fallen out of fashion in most Western countries, but there are still many parts of the world where it's common for the bride's family to provide the groom with an endowment of land and livestock."
Engender,"<i>Engender</i> is a fancy way of saying ""to make happen,"" like when you <i>engender</i> the spirit of teamwork and cooperation by encouraging others and doing your share of the group's work.<br><br>The verb <i>engender</i> has nothing to do with being male or female, though originally, it did mean ""beget, procreate."" Today, <i>engender</i> means ""to produce or bring about."" When students come to class prepared, meaning they've read their assignment, this engenders better class discussions, just as mutual trust and the desire to help each other engenders a meaningful friendship."
Engross,"<i>Engross</i> is a verb that means to consume all of your attention or time. Once you <i>engross</i> yourself in the culture of high salaries and unlimited spending accounts, it's hard to go back to cooking at a sandwich shop.<br><br><i>Engross</i> first came into English in the 1400s from the Old French word <i>en gros</i>, meaning ""in bulk, at wholesale."" By the 1700s the word had taken on the meaning of ""absorb the whole attention."" Immersing yourself fully in something can be good or bad. If you're studying Shakespeare, you want the plays to engross you so you don't lose focus. But if your video games engross you so much that you forget to shower or eat, that's a problem."
Ennui,"The French word <i>ennui</i> describes a feeling that combines tiredness and boredom. <i>Ennui</i> is one version of ""the blahs.""<br><br>Though it sounds it little fancy — maybe because it comes from French — ennui is a common feeling that everybody experiences: being bored and tired. School and work fill lots of people with ennui. A terrible TV show could create ennui. If you feel like your life is going nowhere, ennui could set in. When you're feeling ennui, you might as well take a nap, because you're too drowsy and uninterested to do much of anything else."
Ensemble,"An <i>ensemble</i> is a group of musicians, dancers, or actors who perform together, like an <i>ensemble</i> which has been playing music together for several years.<br><br><i>Ensemble</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>ensemblée,</i> which means ""together, at the same time."" 
Groups of people who perform at the same time are ensembles, so are things that are put together. A collection of short stories or artwork can be an ensemble, but you don't have to be a writer or artist to be complimented on your ensemble — the outfit you are wearing."
Enticing,"Something <i>enticing</i> is exciting and intriguing. <i>Enticing</i> things are tempting and make you want to have them.<br><br>When a thing is enticing, it's kind of like it's saying ""You want this, don't you? Yes you do!"" The goal of almost all advertising is to be enticing — to try to <i>entice</i> you to buy the product. Any small glimpse or snippet of something that you like is probably enticing. Menus are another thing that are supposed to be enticing — you should want to order the food. If a movie trailer isn't enticing, then it didn't do its job."
Entourage,"You know that group of people — friends, assistants, bodyguards — that are always surrounding you everywhere you go?  That's your <i>entourage</i>!<br><br><i>Entourage</i> comes from the French word <i>entourer</i>, meaning “to surround,” and means ""the people who surround someone.""  It's also pronounced like a French word, ending with the soft  sound “razh” (not “rage”): ""ON-too-razh.""  The size of a pop star's entourage might grow with every hit record she releases. You know you've really made it when your entourage won't fit in one limo."
Enunciate,"Can't get your point across? Maybe you just need to speak more clearly or articulate your thoughts better — in short, <i>enunciate</i>.<br><br>Good enunciation is similar to pronunciation, but describes more specifically how clearly someone expresses themselves. The word <i>enunciate</i> is related to the Latin words for both ""announce"" and ""messenger."" So most likely those ancient Romans who created the word wanted a messenger who could announce things without mumbling, grumbling, and rambling."
Epithet,"The noun <i>epithet</i> is a descriptive nickname, such as ""Richard the Lionhearted,"" or ""Tommy the Terrible."" When it takes a turn for the worse, it can also be a word or phrase that offends.<br><br>Don’t let <i>epithet’s</i> bad reputation fool you — that’s only half the story. An epithet can be harmless, a nickname that catches on, like all hockey fans knowing that ""Sid the Kid"" is Sidney Crosby. On the flip side, an epithet can be an abusive word or phrase that should never be used, like a racial epithet that offends and angers everyone."
Epitomize,"If you <i>epitomize</i> something, you’re a perfect example of that thing. If you never get nervous when playing basketball and can always make that last-second shot, your teammates might say you <i>epitomize</i> mental toughness.<br><br>A person can epitomize something — usually an abstract quality, like grace or greed — but <i>epitomize</i> can apply to other things as well. A popular band might epitomize the spirit of the new decade, which means it has all the main characteristics associated with the era's music, like long folksy beards, pretty harmonies, and earnest lyrics. A frustrating situation at work involving careless coworkers might make you say that they epitomize everything that’s wrong with your job."
Erasure,"<i>Erasure</i> is the act of erasing, deleting, or removing something. It's tricky to write an essay on a typewriter instead of a computer, because it's hard to hide any <i>erasures</i>.<br><br>An erasure can be made, appropriately, by erasing pencilled words with an eraser, but there are many other kinds of erasure. You can experience an accidental erasure of a whole day's work by hitting the wrong button on your laptop, and you can choose to hide details of your past with the kind of erasure that involves leaving certain information out when you tell your story. The Latin root is <i>eradere</i>, ""scrape off"" or ""remove."""
Ersatz,"The <i>ersatz</i> version of something is an inferior substitute or imitation. You might speak in an <i>ersatz</i> French accent, but you won't fool the Parisian who runs the local French bakery.<br><br>Used as a noun or adjective, <i>ersatz</i> stems from the German verb <i>ersetzen,</i> which means ""to replace.""  Compared with regular Coke, Diet Coke may be considered an ersatz beverage because of its artificial sweeteners. Similarly, rich, creamy, full-fat ice cream is much better than the ersatz, fat-free version, or frozen yogurt. You would be in deep trouble if your fiancé found out that her engagement ring was an ersatz diamond."
Escapade,"An <i>escapade</i> is an adventure, tinged with a hint of danger. A road trip could be an <i>escapade</i>, or a few weeks making a living as a professional gambler, or posing as your twin sister and taking a test for her in math.<br><br>You'll notice the similarities between the words <i>escapade</i> and <i>escape</i>. Usually an escapade involves some form of escape. If you cut class and spend the day at the beach, that's an escapade. If you cut class to watch former figure-skating greats boogying to Broadway tunes on ice, that's an escapade at the Ice Capades."
Eschew,"If you <i>eschew</i> something, you deliberately avoid it. If you live the bohemian life in the city, then most likely you <i>eschew</i> the suburbs.<br><br><i>Eschew</i> comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to <i>eschew</i> something isn’t simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle––it's stronger than that. You <i>eschew</i> things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might <i>eschew</i> a chocolate sundae, not because he doesn’t like it, but because he’s afraid of what it will do to his waistline."
Evocative,"Use the adjective <i>evocative</i> when you want to describe something that reminds you of something else. If your mom baked a lot when you were a kid, the smell of cookies in the oven is probably <i>evocative</i> of your childhood.<br><br><i>Evocative</i> comes from the Latin word <i>evocare</i>, which means to ""call out"" or ""summon.""  Think of a batch of cookies summoning a memory from your childhood. To summon something you need a voice, and indeed, the Latin word for voice is <i>vocare</i>.  Other related words include the noun <i>vocation</i>, which means ""a calling."""
Exacerbate,"For a formal-sounding verb that means to make worse, try <i>exacerbate</i>. If you're in trouble, complaining about it will only <i>exacerbate</i> the problem.<br><br><i>Exacerbate</i> is related to the adjective <i>acrid</i>, often used to describe sharp-smelling smoke. Think of <i>exacerbate</i> then as a sharp or bitter thing that makes something worse. A drought will exacerbate a country's food shortage. <i>Worsen</i>, <i>intensify</i>, <i>aggravate</i> and <i>compound</i> are similar, but <i>exacerbate</i> has the sense of an irritant being added in to make something bad even worse."
Exasperate,"To <i>exasperate</i> someone is to annoy him or her to the point of impatience, frustration and irritation, like when you <i>exasperate</i> a busy waiter by asking questions like ""what are all the ingredients in the salad dressing?"" and making him repeat the specials five times.<br><br>The verb <i>exasperate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>exasperatus</i>, which means “to roughen,” “irritate,” or “provoke.” To <i>exasperate</i> is to make something that is already bad even worse, like when sitting in traffic that is sure to make you late, you <i>exasperate</i> the person who is driving by bringing up an unpleasant topic, or the addition of twenty more students that <i>exasperates</i> the crowding in the cafeteria."
Exasperation,"If you've ever become so frustrated with someone or something that you feel like you're at the end of your rope, you have experienced <i>exasperation</i>. You are fed up!<br><br><i>Exasperation</i> goes back to the Latin verb <i>exasperare</i>, meaning “to make rough.” When you are in a state of exasperation, you feel like something annoying you've had to put up with has put you in a rough mood. If you take up golf, you might find it to be a source of relaxation or a source of exasperation. Watching you try to teach your dog to fetch, I'm not sure which is more amusing: his stubbornness or your exasperation."
Exculpate,"To <i>exculpate</i> means to find someone not guilty of criminal charges. If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will <i>exculpate</i> you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing.<br><br><i>Exculpate</i> comes from two Latin words: <i>ex-</i>, meaning ""from,"" and <i>culpa</i>, meaning ""blame."" <i>Exculpate</i> is similar in meaning to <i>exonerate</i>. When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it. <i>Exculpate</i> usually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone. So if that judge exculpates you from the robbery charge, everyone in town might still think you did it. Get him to exculpate and exonerate you."
Excursion,"An <i>excursion</i> is taken more for pleasure than for practical reasons. Your business trip, when you spent most of the week waiting in airports and adjusting to different time zones, does not count as an <i>excursion</i>.<br><br>The Latin root for <i>excursion</i> is <i>excurrere</i>, meaning ""to run out."" So if you run out for a bit to get some fresh air, you've gone on an excursion. If you leave specifically to buy milk from the corner store and end up swimming in a stream, you've probably taken an excursion into the woods."
Execrable,"If something's <i>execrable</i> it's really and truly, unbelievably, absolutely the worst.<br><br><i>Execrable</i> is often used as a harshly critical term in the arts, when a reviewer really wants to throw the book at something. Not surprisingly, the word comes from a Latin word meaning ""to utter a curse; to hate or abhor."" Tough words for bad art. Perhaps part of the power and nastiness of <i>execrable</i> lies in the word's similarity to <i>excrement</i> — but that's a vocabulary word we're not touching in this entry!"
Exemplary,"<i>Exemplary</i> people excel at what they do and are excellent examples to others. Something <i>exemplary</i> is so good that it is an example for others to follow.<br><br>When something is the best it can be or reaches the highest point, it is exemplary and thus worth imitating. <i>Exemplary</i> comes from the Latin <i>exemplum,</i> meaning ""sample"" or ""example."" While some people and things are held as examples of what <i>not</i> to do, an exemplary person or thing is always a positive example. A country can have an exemplary record of preventing pollution, and a person may have an exemplary reputation just for being all-around praiseworthy or noble."
Exemplify,"If you <i>exemplify</i> something, you're the perfect example of it.  Say you wear frilly shirts, knee-high boots, and black eye-make-up — you <i>exemplify</i> the fashion world's obsession with pirates.<br><br>Exemplifying something can also mean make it clearer by offering an illustration or an example.  If you want to exemplify your argument that, say, pirate gear is fashionable, you might want to show your friends some pictures of celebrities wearing eye patches."
Exhort,"French roots for the word <i>exhort</i> mean ""thoroughly encourage,"" so to <i>exhort</i> is to fill up with encouragement! ""When he heard the crowd <i>exhort</i> him with stomping and cheers, he knew that he could finish the marathon.""<br><br>Some synonyms for <i>exhort</i> include <i>stimulate</i>, <i>excite</i>, and <i>urge on</i>. Words and shouts can exhort, and this is especially true when the recipient of those chants fears coming up short with an effort. Exhortations may make the difference between winning or losing and marching on or giving up. A sergeant might exhort his troops after a defeat just as a dad can exhort his daughter after a missed note during a piano recital."
Exorbitant,"Use the adjective <i>exorbitant</i> when you want to describe something that is really just too much! You'll often hear people griping about <i>exorbitant</i> bank fees or <i>exorbitant</i> interest rates.<br><br>The adjective <i>exorbitant</i> was originally a legal term to describe a case that was outside the bounds of the law. It comes from the Latin roots — the prefix <i>ex</i>, meaning ""out of,"" and <i>orbita</i>, meaning ""wheel track."" You can see how the word now has come to be described as something that has gone way off the beaten track, especially in terms of price and value."
Expatriate 1.,"An <i>expatriate</i> is someone who lives in another country by choice. If you leave your split-level ranch in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an <i>expatriate</i>.<br><br><i>Expatriate</i> can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has <i>expatriated</i>. There was a scene of <i>expatriates</i>, or <i>expats</i>, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country — it's from the French word <i>expatrier</i> which means ""banish."" The prefix <i>ex</i> means ""out of"" and  the Latin <i>patria</i> ""one's native country,"" but the word took a turn and now refers to people who left without getting shoved out."
Expatriate 2.,"An <i>expatriate</i> is someone who lives in another country by choice. If you leave your split-level ranch in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an <i>expatriate</i>.<br><br><i>Expatriate</i> can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has <i>expatriated</i>. There was a scene of <i>expatriates</i>, or <i>expats</i>, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country — it's from the French word <i>expatrier</i> which means ""banish."" The prefix <i>ex</i> means ""out of"" and  the Latin <i>patria</i> ""one's native country,"" but the word took a turn and now refers to people who left without getting shoved out."
Expatriate 3.,"An <i>expatriate</i> is someone who lives in another country by choice. If you leave your split-level ranch in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an <i>expatriate</i>.<br><br><i>Expatriate</i> can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has <i>expatriated</i>. There was a scene of <i>expatriates</i>, or <i>expats</i>, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country — it's from the French word <i>expatrier</i> which means ""banish."" The prefix <i>ex</i> means ""out of"" and  the Latin <i>patria</i> ""one's native country,"" but the word took a turn and now refers to people who left without getting shoved out."
Expedient,"The adjective <i>expedient</i> describes something that provides an easy way to achieve a goal or result, but it's not necessarily a moral solution.<br><br><i>Politically expedient</i> means something you do to advance yourself politically. Use <i>expedient</i> when you want to hint that a particular solution or strategy has certain benefits and advantages but is not completely fair. However, <i>expedient</i> can also be used as a noun to describe something practical for a particular purpose."
Expedite,"To <i>expedite</i> something is to make it go faster or speed up the process. <i>Expediting</i> that package might get it to Alaska by tomorrow, instead of next Tuesday.<br><br>If someone says, ""Let me <i>expedite</i> the process,"" that's probably a good thing: they're offering to speed things up. If you've ever waited in line a long time, then you must have wished someone could expedite things. A driver can expedite his commute by going in the faster car-pool lane. Whenever there's a lot of paperwork for something, it's nice to know someone who can expedite the process. When you see the word <i>expedite</i>, think ""Make faster!"""
Exponent,"An <i>exponent</i> is a person who is a big promoter of something. Are you an <i>exponent</i> of the four-day school and work week?<br><br>You may already know the mathematical meaning of <i>exponent</i>: a numeric notation showing how many times a number is multiplied by itself. How did <i>exponent</i> come to mean a strong advocate or promoter of something? Well, its Latin ancestor was a verb meaning ""to put forth"" and it's easy to see how this could be generalized to refer to people. After all, aren't you an exponent of freedom of expression?"
Expurgate,"To <i>expurgate</i> is to censor. Usually, people talk about <i>expurgating</i> bad words from something written or on TV.<br><br>On TV, if you hear some words bleeped out, those words have been expurgated. In print, we can expurgate by using dashes ( —  — ) or random characters like %&amp;$#. Sometimes we can expurgate just by rewriting something so that the entire sentence with the naughty parts is gone, or by putting it into mild words. When it comes to things children read or watch, there's often the difficult question of what to expurgate and what to leave alone."
Extol,"If you have a crush on a guy who likes your best friend, it can be very depressing to listen to him <i>extol</i> your friend's virtues, while you just nod and smile. If you <i>extol</i> something, you praise it very highly.<br><br>The Bible says: ""Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and <i>extol</i> and honor the King of heaven..."" Nebuchadnezzar II was king of the second Babylonian Empire, the one who sent the Jews into exile. In some translations of the Bible, the word <i>honor</i> is replaced with <i>glorify</i>. <i>Praise, extol, honor, glorify</i> all mean about the same. The Bible often uses five words when one would be enough."
Extrinsic,"Extrinsic means not connected to the essential nature of something. New cleats are <i>extrinsic</i> to making the soccer team. How you play is what gets you on the team, whether your cleats are old or new.<br><br>If the <i>ex</i> in <i>extrinsic</i> makes you think of <i>external</i> or <i>extra</i> you’re on the right track––all these <i>ex</i> words are talking about something that is outside, or above and beyond. You often hear <i>extrinsic</i> paired with its opposite, <i>intrinsic</i>, which means part of something or someone's essential nature. If being sweet-tempered is intrinsic to your personality, you might not even know how to get mad."
Fallacy,"A <i>fallacy</i> is a misleading argument or belief based on a falsehood. If you oppose state testing in schools, you think it is a <i>fallacy</i> that educational quality can be measured by standardized tests.<br><br><i>Fallacy</i> comes from the Latin <i>fallacia</i>, for deceit. It technically means a flaw in an argument that makes it deceptive or misleading. In poetry, the ""pathetic fallacy"" is the false idea that things like rocks or stars have human feelings (pathos). <i>Fallacy</i> can also be used more generally for any false statement or idea. Some synonyms are <i>misconception</i> and <i>error</i>."
Fallow,"Something that is <i>fallow</i> is left unused. If you’re smart but lazy, someone might say you have a <i>fallow</i> mind.<br><br>We use the word to talk about any unused resource, it started as a work about land. <i>Fallow</i> comes from the old English word for plowing, and refers to the practice of leaving fields unplowed in rotation––when a field lies fallow, the soil regains nutrients that are sucked up by over-planting."
Fanfare,"<i>Fanfare</i> is a loud, proud burst of something to get attention. If you open up a carpet store with one of those sky-sweeping lights, lots of balloons, and a brass band, you’re doing it with great <i>fanfare</i>.<br><br>Originally <i>fanfare</i> meant a short burst of music played by trumpeters, usually when someone important entered a room. But these days we describe anything as <i>fanfare</i> that has the same feeling as a burst of trumpets. If you’re a TV executive with a new show you think is going to be a big hit, roll it out with  <i>fanfare</i>–—ad campaigns, billboards, celebrity parties!"
Faux,"<i>Faux</i> means fake, or imitation. If you love the look of diamonds but can't afford one, get a <i>faux</i> diamond ring.<br><br><i>Faux</i> is a French word that has crept into our lexicon, because <i>faux</i> in French means ""fake."" Now if we have the words <i>fake</i>, <i>imitation</i>, and <i>false</i> (all of which are good synonyms), why use <i>faux</i>? For fashion, dahling. Use <i>faux</i> to talk about faux fur, faux gemstones, or to make fun of a ""faux pas,"" which is French for ""no-no,"" widely used among the witty international set when someone does something <i>gauche</i> (French for ""clumsy"")."
Fawn,"A <i>fawn</i> is a young deer, but it's also a verb meaning to try and win favor by flattering. You might <i>fawn</i> over Bambi if you want to hang out with the cute and fuzzy gang.<br><br>As a verb, <i>fawn</i> either refers to an attempt to get on someone’s good side, or, oddly enough, to give birth to a deer. If you're a human, fawning is an age-old art that might get you what you want but can be very unattractive. If you ever come into possession of a great fortune, watch out for sudden friends who want to fawn over you and shower you with presents. They probably have dollar signs in their eyes."
Fealty,"Stemming from the Latin word ""fidelitas,"" the noun <i>fealty</i> is related to ""fidelity,"" and is another way of saying ""loyalty"" or ""faithfulness.""<br><br>Most school kids pledge their fealty, or allegiance, to the United States of America every morning in homeroom. But if you think <i>fealty</i> sounds like a word King Arthur would use, you're right: It's really an outdated term that primarily describes a vassal's sworn allegiance to a feudal lord."
Feasible,"If something is <i>feasible</i>, then you can do it without too much difficulty. When someone asks ""Is it <i>feasible</i>?"" the person is asking if you'll be able to get something done.<br><br>Feasible things are possible. If you have enough time, money, or energy to do something, it's feasible. Something might be feasible at one time and then not feasible at another time. Because of technological advances and competition with the Russians, going to the moon was feasible for the United States in the sixties. Often, people disagree about what's feasible, especially in politics, where how feasible a project is counts for a lot."
Feign,"For a more formal way to say pretend to or imitate, choose the verb <i>feign.</i> You might <i>feign</i> indifference when you hear about some gossip, but you're probably dying to know.<br><br><i>Feign</i> comes from the Latin <i>fingere</i> ""to devise, fabricate."" The word <i>fiction</i> comes from the same source, so if you feign something such as sleep, you give off the fiction that you are sleeping. This can done to be polite but also to deceive such as when you feign an injury or the flu so you can stay home from school or work. You can also feign an accent, though some are better at this than others."
Feint,"Did you ever tell your parents you were going off to school, grabbed your book bag, and headed out the door... only to spend the rest of the day hanging out with your friends? Well, that was a <i>feint,</i> a super sneaky move designed to fool someone.<br><br>Although military and political tactics are big on feints, their most common use is probably in sports — particularly boxing, where opponents are continually trying to fake each other out. As in Dundee's account of an Ali-Frazier match: ""Ali feinted with a jab, and Frazier threw one of his own, missing."" Not to be confused with <i>faint,</i> meaning ""weak or feeble."" However, a feint can be deliberately faint, as Ali knew and Frazier found out when the real right hook made contact."
Ferret 1.,"You may be familiar with ferrets, those adorable little mammals that look like cheap minks. Well, the verb to <i>ferret</i> means to act like a ferret: to dig for something until you find it.<br><br><i>Ferrets</i> are great at digging, so it's no surprise that we acknowledge their skills when we make the verb <i>ferret</i>, which almost always comes attached to the preposition ""out."" Woodward and Bernstein worked tirelessly to ferret out the names of the guys who raided the Watergate offices. When you're ready, I'm going to ask you to ferret out those two photos from that stack of photo boxes."
Ferret 2.,"You may be familiar with ferrets, those adorable little mammals that look like cheap minks.

Woodward and Bernstein worked tirelessly to ferret out the names of the guys who raided the Watergate offices. When you're ready, I'm going to ask you to ferret out those two photos from that stack of photo boxes."
Fervent,"Use <i>fervent</i> to describe a person or thing that shows very strong feelings or enthusiasm. If you have a <i>fervent</i> desire to become an actress, you'll stop at nothing to realize your dream.<br><br>The adjective <i>fervent</i> and the noun <i>fervor</i> are often associated with the feelings aroused by patriotism, religion, or a belief that you support or oppose. A near synonym for the adjective is <i>ardent</i>. <i>Fervent</i> is from Middle English, from Old French, from the Latin verb <i>fervēre</i> ""to boil, glow."""
Fervor,"Use <i>fervor</i> to describe an intensity of emotion or expression. Fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers show so much <i>fervor</i> that they ""bleed Dodger blue.""<br><br>This noun comes to us from Latin <i>fervere</i>, meaning ""to boil, glow."" In the English word <i>fervor</i>, the suffix <i>–or</i> means ""a condition or property of something."" There is another <i>–or</i> suffix that means ""a person or thing that does the thing expressed by the verb."" A corresponding adjective is <i>fervent</i>; synonyms of the noun and adjective are <i>ardor</i> and <i>ardent</i>."
Festoon,"A <i>festoon</i> is a decorative string of flowers that you drape across a room, dropping in curves between support points. If you're decorating for Halloween, why not try a creatively spooky <i>festoon</i> of dried roses covered in cobwebs?<br><br><i>Festoon</i> probably comes from the Italian word <i>festone</i>, for ""feast,"" and if you can imagine an Italian courtyard strung up with flowers and lanterns, then you have a sense of what it means to festoon a place. A noun or a verb, <i>festoon</i> can mean the decoration itself, or the work of putting it up. Festoons don't strictly have to be made of flowers, though they usually are. You can festoon with fabric too, or paper chains. Or cobwebs."
Fetid,"If you want to understand the true meaning of  <i>fetid</i>, leave your sweaty gym clothes in your locker for a few days.  <i>Fetid</i> is a fancy way of saying that something smells really bad.<br><br>From the Latin word meaning ""stinking,"" this adjective has been in use since the early 15th century, which was a particularly <i>fetid</i> time in history — showers, laundry detergent, and deodorant had not yet been invented.  Here's an easy way to remember it: ""the fe(e)t (d)id stink."" It's sometimes spelled <i>foetid</i>."
Fickle,"People who are <i>fickle</i> change their minds so much you can't rely on them. If your best friend suddenly decides that she doesn't like you one week, and then the next week she wants to hang out again, she's being <i>fickle</i>.<br><br><i>Fickle</i> comes from the Old English word <i>ficol</i>, for deceitful.  We usually use <i>fickle</i> to talk about people, but it can also be used for abstract things that alternately favor you and abuse you, like the weather. If you win the lottery and then lose everything else in the world that's important to you, fate is being fickle."
Fidelity,"<i>Fidelity</i> is the quality of being faithful or loyal. Dogs are famous for their <i>fidelity</i>.<br><br><i>Fidelity</i> comes from the Latin root <i>fides</i>, which means faith, so <i>fidelity</i> is the state of being faithful. Marital fidelity is faithfulness to your spouse. If you're a journalist, your reports should have fidelity to the facts.  Someone without fidelity to a religion or group belief is called an <i>infidel</i>."
Flaccid,"If something is limp, loose, droopy, and wrinkly, you can call it <i>flaccid,</i> which rhymes with ""acid."" Think elephant skin, soggy asparagus, and the type of feeble handshakes frowned on in job interviews.<br><br>We get the word <i>flaccid</i> from the Latin <i>flaccus</i>, which meant ""flabby."" The meaning is pretty much the same today, though it applies to  more than physical flab. <i>Flaccid</i> pops up in conversation to describe lackluster leadership, dull conversation, and even feeble attempts at word definitions. If a politician's election campaign is flaccid, it will surprise no one that he only receives two votes — one from his grandmother and the other from someone who accidentally checked the wrong box on the ballot."
Flagrant,"Something <i>flagrant</i> is bad — so bad you can't ignore it. A <i>flagrant</i> foul in sports might send you to the bench, and a <i>flagrant</i> violation of the law might send you to the slammer.<br><br>The current meaning of the adjective <i>flagrant</i> — ""obviously offensive or disgraceful"" — is thought to derive from the Latin legal term <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, which literally meant ""with fire still blazing"" and is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is caught red handed. Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word can also be used to describe anything that is obviously bad — like flagrant bad taste or flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar."
Flinty,"Something that's made of or contains flint, or hard silica rock, is <i>flinty</i>. <i>Flinty</i> soil is rough and rocky, and not the best for planting a garden.<br><br>Flinty earth is studded with jagged flakes of flint, and the adjective is often used in a figurative way to capture an equally rough and stony mood or personality. Your flinty uncle, for example, might be gruff and unsmiling. Since the 16th century <i>flinty</i> has been used this way, to mean ""hard-hearted"" or ""tough as flint."" The ""full of flint"" meaning is slightly newer."
Flippant,"When a parent scolds a teenager for missing a curfew or blowing off a test and the teen snaps back, ""Whatever,"" you could say the teen is being <i>flippant</i>. His reply was casual to the point of sarcasm and disrespect.<br><br>When it first showed up in the English language around the 17th century, <i>flippant</i> meant glib and talkative. But over the years it has developed a more negative connotation. Today <i>flippant</i> is used to describe a blasé attitude or comment in a situation that calls for seriousness. Make a flippant comment about your friend's mother and the odds are good that they'll be offended."
Flotsam,"<i>Flotsam</i> is the floating wreckage of a ship. You'll often hear it used with the word <i>jetsam</i>, which refers to floating objects that have been thrown from a ship, usually to lighten it before it sinks.<br><br>You can keep flotsam and jetsam straight by remembering that <i>flotsam</i> looks like the word, float, and <i>jetsam</i> looks like jettison which means to cast off. Usually it doesn't matter though as flotsam and jetsam are used together as an expression, mostly figuratively to mean to mean things or people who are unwanted or discarded. What about the things that are cast from a ship but sink to the ocean floor instead of floating? That's called <i>lagan</i>."
Flub 1.,"To <i>flub</i> something is to really mess it up. When a movie actor <i>flubs</i> his lines, the scene can be filmed again. But, if he's a stage actor, there's no way to fix the mistake.<br><br>Even a star basketball player flubs an easy layup sometimes, and the very best students occasionally flub a quiz. The mistake or blunder itself can also be called a <i>flub</i>: ""The concert was terrible, full of <i>flubs</i>."" The word's been around since the 1920's, possibly influenced by words like ""fluff"" and ""flop,"" and definitely coined in the United States."
Flub 2.,"To <i>flub</i> something is to really mess it up. When a movie actor <i>flubs</i> his lines, the scene can be filmed again. But, if he's a stage actor, there's no way to fix the mistake.<br><br>Even a star basketball player flubs an easy layup sometimes, and the very best students occasionally flub a quiz. The mistake or blunder itself can also be called a <i>flub</i>: ""The concert was terrible, full of <i>flubs</i>."" The word's been around since the 1920's, possibly influenced by words like ""fluff"" and ""flop,"" and definitely coined in the United States."
Fodder,"<i>Fodder</i> is cheap food, usually given to livestock animals like cows. If you gave a cow caviar or homemade scones, that would not be <i>fodder</i>. Try cornstalks.<br><br><i>Fodder</i> is not just used to describe cattle feed. We use the word to talk about other kinds of feeding that don't involve actual food. A new celebrity marriage is fodder for gossip magazines. In war, the soldiers most likely to be killed, are called cannon fodder, from the times when armies used canons instead of drone aircraft dropping missiles."
Foil,"You can serve as a <i>foil</i> to someone if you show them to be better than you by contrast. If you can't dance but your friend Lisa can, you can be a <i>foil</i> to Lisa's grace.<br><br>If you're having trouble remembering this definition, think about a shiny piece of tin foil. It reflects an image back to you, so if you're a foil to someone, their image is reflected off of you in a positive light. Your brother's mediocre grades might serve as a foil to your intelligence. As a verb, if you foil someone's plans or attempts to do something, you cause them to fail. Your brother will be really mad if you foil his plans to hide his mediocre report card from your parents."
Foist,"Did your parents <i>foist</i> your baby sister on you when they went out? It means they forced her on you. Anything — a person or object or idea — can be <i>foisted</i> if it's done by force upon an unwilling party.<br><br><i>Foist</i> used to imply a degree of deception rather than just brute force, but that's a meaning that's pretty much lost now: if something's <i>foisted</i> upon you, you know about it. The earlier meaning comes from an old Dutch term for palming a loaded die into a game. Today we call that cheating."
Foment,"Stand outside the school cafeteria passing out flyers with nutritional details on school food, and you may <i>foment</i> a revolution––<i>foment</i> means stirring up something undesirable, such as trouble.<br><br>You would never say, ""Hooray, we <i>fomented</i> a revolution."" Instead you'd say, ""Those good for nothing scalawags fomented the rebellion."" Don't confuse <i>foment</i> and <i>ferment</i>. <i>Ferment</i> can mean ""to stir up"" in a good way––a football game can ferment excitement in a town, or foment trouble through traffic tie-ups and litter."
Forbid,"When you <i>forbid</i> something, you refuse to allow it. You might have heard your parents say things like, ""I <i>forbid</i> you to play ball in the house!"" or ""I <i>forbid</i> you to have any more parties when we're not home!""<br><br><i>Forbid</i> comes from the Old English word <i>forbeodan</i>, meaning ""forbid, prohibit."" <i>Forbid</i> can also mean ""prevent"" or ""keep from happening."" The spare tire on your car will <i>forbid</i> you from driving any faster than 40 miles an hour — any faster and the car will shake. You may have heard <i>forbid</i> used in the expression ""God forbid . . ."" This refers to something you hope will not happen, so much so that you're asking God for a little help."
Force Majeure,"A <i>force majeure</i> is a calamity that is beyond anyone's control and changes life in unpredictable ways. A tornado that devastates your town is a <i>force majeure</i>.<br><br>The noun <i>force majeure</i> is a French term that literally means ""greater force"" or ""superior strength."" It's no ordinary occurrence, but something that is overwhelming and unexpected, like a war, a hurricane, or an asteroid landing on your roof. It's also a legally valid excuse for not fulfilling an obligation or contract — everyone involved will agree that it was unavoidable."
Forebear,"Your father, grandmother, and great grandfather are all your <i>forebears</i>. A <i>forebear</i> is an ancestor, or someone you are descended from.<br><br>You might have thought that <i>forebear</i> means to stop yourself from doing something. The word you are thinking of is <i>forbear</i>. Confused? The ""e"" makes all of the difference here. Whereas the first is a noun, the second is a verb. Just remember that if you see <i>fore</i> like in <i>before</i>, it's the people who came before you."
Foreboding,"When you get a <i>foreboding,</i> you get a sense that something bad is going to happen. A <i>foreboding</i> is a foretelling, a sign or a glimpse, that ""something wicked this way comes"" — or might come.<br><br>If something doesn’t ""bode"" well, it means that the future doesn't look good. A <i>foreboding</i> is a glimpse or a feeling that bad things are going to happen. It's a premonition, or look into the future. Most times <i>foreboding</i> implies that something evil is coming, but sometimes it's used for anything bad up ahead, as in ""she had a foreboding that the trip would get canceled due to the hurricane."" Even if the future looks bright, a foreboding casts dread over what's ahead."
Foreword,"Many students tend to skip the <i>foreword</i> at the beginning of a long novel, or go back and read it later.<br><br>Use the noun <i>foreword</i> for an introduction that comes at the start of a book. A foreword is usually written by someone other than the author and it gives information about the critical reception of the book, personal history of the author, or some other extra detail of interest to the reader. The word <i>foreword</i>  combines <i>fore</i>, ""before, or first"" and <i>word</i>, and it's closely connected to the German word for ""preface,"" <i>Vorwort</i>."
Formidable,"What do the national debt, your old gym teacher, and your mother-in-law have in common? They're all <i>formidable</i> — that is, they inspire fear and respect thanks to their size, or special ability, or unusual  qualities. (Or possibly all three in the case of your mother-in-law.)<br><br>What's interesting about <i>formidable</i> is that we often tend to use it about things that, while they may scare us, we can't help being pretty impressed by all the same. A formidable opponent is almost by definition a worthy one; a formidable challenge almost by definition one worth rising to. Not surprisingly, this word is derived from the Latin <i>formidare,</i> ""to fear."""
Fortuitous,"<i>Fortuitous</i> means by chance, like a lucky accident. If you and your best friend's families happen to go on vacation to the same place at the same time, that’s a <i>fortuitous</i> coincidence!<br><br>Something fortuitous is random like an accident, but there’s no downside. A rock falling on your head is an accident, dollar bills falling on your head is fortuitous. The meaning of <i>fortuitous</i> is changing from ""happening by chance"" to ""lucky chance"" because people get it mixed up with <i>fortunate</i>.  But watch out: If you say <i>fortuitous</i> to mean just plain lucky without the element of chance –– that's a usage error."
Fowling,"The noun <i>fowl</i> usually means domesticated birds kept for eating or producing eggs. If your friend brings you eggs from the chickens she keeps in her back yard, you can say that she has pet <i>fowl</i>.<br><br><i>Fowl</i> comes from the Old English <i>fugel</i>, ""bird,"" meant simply that — ""bird."" Today, <i>fowl</i> usually refers specifically to chickens or other kinds of domesticated birds that lay eggs or are raised to be eaten. Occasionally, <i>fowl</i> is used interchangeably with <i>poultry</i>, to mean the flesh of that same kind of bird when it's eaten; you could describe your family as being fond of pork, beef, and fowl."
Fracas,"If your marching band gets into a fight with another school's pep squad, your principal might say the <i>fracas</i> was uncalled for and undignified. A <i>fracas</i> is a noisy quarrel.<br><br><i>Fracas</i> comes from an Italian word meaning uproar or crash. Two people in a quiet little spat is not a fracas, but a schoolyard rumble definitely qualifies as one! Sometimes <i>fracas</i> means the large amount of outraged discussion that an event causes. Imagine the fracas if your school decided to ban sneakers!"
Fraternize,"Guys, you may not realize it, but when you hang out with your buds, you <i>fraternize;</i> that is, you associate in a friendly fashion with other men as though they were your brothers.<br><br>As your wives or girlfriends would be quick to tell you, there's an undercurrent of misbehavior to the term <i>fraternize.</i> At its most harmless, it means a kind of wild frat house behavior (frat or fraternity also coming from the Latin term <i>fraternus</i>, meaning ""brotherly.""). At its worst, there's an implication of illegality or skullduggery, as in the common phrase ""<i>fraternizing</i> with the enemy."" So party on, but don't be a traitor."
Fraught,"<i>Fraught</i> means filled with something — often something bad. Your Thanksgiving was <i>fraught</i> with awkward moments when your family saw your blue hair, and it only got worse when you told them you'd quit law school to join the circus.<br><br><i>Fraught</i> is related to the word <i>freight</i>, and comes from the Middle English <i>fraughten</i>, meaning ""to load with cargo."" Think of a cargo ship loaded up with freight for a journey — it's full of supplies, just like Thanksgiving was filled with — or fraught with — awkward moments. <i>Fraught</i> can also describe a situation filled with distress. If relations between two countries are fraught, they are not getting along with each other."
Fringe,"If you make cutoffs from jeans, the little white strings around the edges of the legs make a <i>fringe</i>. A <i>fringe</i> is a decorative edge made of hanging strings of fabric.<br><br>You know how fringe hangs on the edge of fabric and clothing? Think of this picture when you see <i>fringe</i> used metaphorically to mean something that is on the outer boundaries of something else. Many cities hold events called fringe festivals that celebrate art created on the fringe of the established art world. A group of people whose beliefs place them on the outskirts of a social group is called a fringe group. And beware of the lunatic fringe — they are the extremists and fanatics of a social or political movement."
Frothy,"Something <i>frothy</i> is composed of many small air bubbles. You might like your cappuccino <i>frothy</i> but probably not your tap water.<br><br>If you order a cappuccino at a cafe, you'll get a cup of strong coffee topped with frothy milk, and a cake recipe might instruct you to beat four eggs until they're frothy. In both examples, air bubbles cause a liquid to become foamy and creamy. A frothy person, however, is bubbly in a different way, full of life and excitement. There's often an implication of ""insubstantial,"" or even ""silly"" when a person or idea is described as frothy."
Fruition,"An idea that is made real, such as a plan or an apple, has come to <i>fruition</i>.<br><br><i>Fruition</i> is a happy word: it's derived from the Latin, <i>frui</i>, meaning ""to enjoy."" We like it when our hard work pays off and ideas come to <i>fruition</i>, like Sally, who was thrilled when her plan to get into law school came to <i>fruition</i>. When the kids' idea to start a wild tricycle gang came to <i>fruition</i>, they sped off joyfully. It refers to the state of bearing fruit, too, like when apples in the orchard come to <i>fruition</i>. The trees are probably happy then, too."
Furlough,"<i>Furlough</i> started as a word for time off from military duty. It spread from there to other types of time off, including an employer <i>furloughing</i> (or laying off) employees.<br><br>If you're in the military — a pretty tough job — you're probably looking forward to a furlough. That's a leave of absence or bit of time off, kind of like a break or vacation. That kind of a furlough is a great chance for some rest and relaxation. Outside the military, to <i>furlough</i> still means to grant a leave of absence to someone, but often it's a permanent vacation: if your boss furloughed you, he fired you."
Furtive,"If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly or secret, sneak in <i>furtive.</i> Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your <i>furtive</i> attempts to pass notes in class!<br><br>The adjective, <i>furtive,</i> is related to <i>fūrtum,</i> the Latin word for theft or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions ""to give someone a <i>furtive</i> glance"" and ""to steal a glance at someone"" mean the same thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting suspiciously. <i>Secret</i>, <i>stealthy</i> and <i>sly</i> are all similar in meaning, but they lack this image of a thief's actions."
Gaffe,"A <i>gaffe</i> is a mistake that embarrasses you in front of others. If you run into a friend out with her grey-haired father, and you blurt out, ""Oh, hi, you must be Tara's grandfather!"" then you've made a <i>gaffe</i>.<br><br><i>Gaffe</i> rhymes with <i>laugh</i>, and you'll be lucky if that's how people respond to your social blunder. A gaffe seems to occur most often when you literally don't know your audience — you make a joke about the mayor; you didn't know you were talking to his sister. That's definitely a gaffe. And who knew your hosts come from a culture that takes offense if you refuse to try every dish?"
Gall,"<i>Gall</i> describes something irritating, like someone very rude. If you barge into a bakery and cut in front of a sweet old lady, then you have <i>gall</i>.<br><br>If someone has gall, they're irritating. In fact, as a verb, <i>gall</i> means ""to irritate"" like new tight jeans that gall your thighs. <i>Gall</i> is ""bile,"" too,  like what's in a gall bladder. Back in the days of Hippocrates, if the four humors of the body were out of whack, it affected your spirits. If you had too much bile, or gall, then you'd be aggressive or depressed. It's also a noun for ""deep feeling of ill will."""
Gamut,"A visit with a long-lost cousin might arouse emotions that run the <i>gamut</i> of joy, regret, sorrow, and excitement. A <i>gamut</i> is a full or complete range.<br><br>In the 16th century, the gamut was the lowest note on the musical scale. In music as well as life, the word has expanded to mean from high to low, or the whole range. The word is often associated with ""run,"" as in ""run the <i>gamut</i> from totally excited to so terrified you're quaking with fear."" And if you've talked about every discussion point on your agenda, you've covered the gamut of issues that need discussing."
Gargantuan,"Whether you're talking about your <i>gargantuan</i> appetite or a <i>gargantuan</i> building, use the word <i>gargantuan</i> to describe something so big that big just isn't, well, big enough to accurately describe it.<br><br>The word <i>gargantuan</i> can refer to an object that's physically massive in size or it can describe something that you perceive, like a feeling or an expectation. For example, you might have a gargantuan misunderstanding with your best friend. The word <i>gargantuan</i> came into English in the 16th century from Gargantua, a character in a series of French novels by the author Francois Rabelais. The books followed the adventures of two giants who were father and son."
Garrulous,"A <i>garrulous</i> person just won’t stop talking (and talking, and talking, and talking...).<br><br><i>Garrulous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>garrire</i> for ""chattering or prattling."" If someone is garrulous, he doesn't just like to talk; he indulges in talking for talking’s sake — whether or not there’s a real conversation going on. If you discover that you have a garrulous neighbor sitting next to you on the plane, you might just want to feign sleep, unless you really want to hear everything going through his mind for the entire trip."
Gawk,"When you stare in amazement at something, you <i>gawk</i> at it. You might stand frozen in one position with your mouth and eyes wide open and <i>gawk</i> when you see a famous movie star on the street.<br><br>The verb <i>gawk</i> was first recorded in American English in 1785. It may have evolved from the word <i>gaw</i>, which came from the Middle English word <i>gowen</i>, meaning ""to stare."" When you <i>gawk</i> at something, you get completely absorbed in what you're looking at. It's usually not considered polite behavior to <i>gawk</i> at another person, especially if it's someone you find attractive. After all, staring is rude."
Genesis,"When you talk about the <i>genesis</i> of something, you're talking about where it began. The <i>genesis</i> of hip-hop music was the party scene in New York City’s South Bronx in the 1970s.<br><br>The Jewish Torah and the Christian Scriptures begin with the book of Genesis, which describes God separating light from darkness and creating the universe. <i>Genesis</i> is the very start of something, its birth. But you probably wouldn't refer to your own birth as a genesis.  When you describe something as a genesis, you're usually referring to the beginning of a movement or an idea."
Ghastly,"Something that's <i>ghastly</i> isn't just gross. It's shockingly, horrifyingly unpleasant — so gruesome and grisly that it makes you want to puke.<br><br>An adjective used to describe that which inspires visions of death and feelings of revulsion, <i>ghastly</i> originated circa 1300. It is very close in meaning to the similarly spelled <i>ghostly</i>. In fact, the word in Old English was originally spelled <i>gastli</i>. But over the years, people confused <i>gastli</i> with <i>ghost</i>, began to adopt the gh- spelling. But don't you forget the ""h"" - that would be a ghastly spelling error on your part."
Girth,"The <i>girth</i>  of something is the distance around its middle, and it usually refers to a person’s waist. If you get pregnant with twins, your <i>girth</i> will probably block your view of your toes.<br><br>One can measure the girth — diameter of the mid-section — of an airplane, tree trunk, or anything cylindrical, but it most often describes a large human waist. A rail-thin person doesn’t have a “minuscule <i>girth</i>,” but when Aunt Velma has her seventh helping of lasagna and has to unbuckle her belt, her girth has outsized her attire. <i>Girth</i> can also mean a strap that encircles the belly of a horse, mule, or other animal to secure a load."
Glaring,"Whether it's a bright light or a fault, <i>glaring</i> things are obvious. You just can't miss them.<br><br>Something glaring is obvious to everyone. Sometimes, there's a glaring light that's in your eyes, such as the glaring beams of the sun. Other times, it could be a glaring fault. For example, if you're a very short basketball player, your height is something everyone knows you have to overcome: it's a glaring problem for that sport. Things that are glaring in this way are almost always bad: there aren't any glaring ice cream cones or puppies. You can't avoid looking at things that are glaring, but you wish you could."
Glean,"Seeing a word in context lets you <i>glean</i> information about how it's used. <i>Glean</i> means to gather bit by bit. You might say, ""I couldn't understand her accent, but from what I could <i>glean</i>, she needs money to take the bus.""<br><br>In the <i>Book of Ruth</i> in <i>The Bible</i>, Ruth meets her future husband when she asked permission to <i>glean</i> from his fields, which means follow the grain cutters, gathering the seed kernels that have fallen on the ground. For the very poor at this time, <i>gleaning</i> was often means of getting food."
Graft,"<i>Graft</i> can mean bribery or corruption. It's also a way of transplanting skin or bones in medicine, as in a skin <i>graft</i>.<br><br>People who get terrible burns on their faces often have pieces of skin taken from other parts of their bodies to help them heal and look better. That transplanted skin is called a <i>graft</i>. There are also <i>grafts</i> in agriculture, when farmers take a branch from one tree and graft it onto another tree. The most common use of <i>graft</i> is in political corruption cases when politicians are accused of taking money in exchange for granting favors."
Grapple,"When you wrestle with something — literally or figuratively — you <i>grapple</i> with it, or try to overcome it.<br><br>If you trace the word <i>grapple</i> back to its French roots, you’ll discover that the word originally referred to ""a grape hook,"" a pronged tool used to harvest grapes. If you think about how awkward it would be to harvest grapes, with the individual grapes ready to scatter everywhere, it makes sense that <i>grapple</i> eventually evolved to include a verb form used to describe struggling with something unruly. You might grapple with a budget shortfall, grapple for answers, grapple with a wrestling opponent, or grapple with a new technology."
Gripe,"The word <i>gripe</i>, as both noun and verb, refers to a minor complaint. Why <i>gripe</i> about the size of the portions when the food is so awful?<br><br>The key to <i>gripe</i> is that as complaints go, it's trivial. You don't gripe about your house burning down or the cost of medical care. You gripe about your friend's status updates and the fact the Yankees have too much money. A gripe can last a while. For example, the city has been hearing gripes about parking rules for a generation, but as complaints go, it's just not getting a lot of traction. One person's gripe, however, can be another person's major headache. It all depends on your point of view."
Grisly,"<i>Grisly</i> means disgusting and bloody, absolutely repulsive and horrible. There’s a wonderfully creepy movie about a man who suffers a <i>grisly</i> death at the hands of the grizzly bears he was studying.<br><br>Do you like grisly horror movies? You might think that the reason the word <i>grisly</i> is so creepy, gruesome, and terrifying is somehow related to <i>gristle</i>, those really nasty tough parts you find in meat. But no, this is not the case. Old English <i>grislic</i>, the root of the word, means ""horrible, dreadful."" If something is gory and gross, it’s grisly."
Grouse,"A <i>grouse</i> is a small game bird. But the verb to <i>grouse</i> is different. It means to gripe about how unhappy you are. It's not recommended for most people, because <i>grousing</i> is unattractive.<br><br>People's excitement about the rise of the Internet has been largely replaced by disappointment that it's turned out to be essentially a forum for people to <i>grouse</i>. No disappointment is too small to grouse about on the Internet. Did you stub your toe? Grouse about it in your blog! Did your sister tattletale? Get online and start grousing. ""I grouse, therefore I am,"" might be the motto of the Internet. Oh well: now I'm grousing too."
Gruesome,"Gothic novels, horror movies, and crime dramas don't shy away from showing <i>gruesome</i> scenes of death, pictures that inspire fright and repulsion. Synonyms include ""ghastly,"" ""grisly,"" ""loathsome,"" and ""macabre.""<br><br>Once upon a time, English contained a variety of words related to <i>gruesome</i>. The verb <i>grue</i>  meant ""to shudder,"" just as its Middle Dutch source <i>gruwen</i> did. <i>Grueful</i> and <i>grueing</i> also conveyed the sense of shivering with horror and disgust. All of these variations have been lost leaving us only with <i>gruesome</i>. Texting while driving has caused many gruesome accidents that you might not want to hear the gruesome details of. Although if you like gruesome movies, you might want to know."
Gruff,"<i>Gruff</i> is an abrupt or forbidding tone. It's the kind of short, brusque response you'd give a telemarketer who called you in the middle of dinner — right before you hung up.<br><br><i>Gruff</i> is the perfect adjective to describe a crotchety old man who rarely leaves his house and yells at any children who dare to cross his lawn. You can almost imagine the rough tone of his voice as he points his cane at those pesky ""trespassers,"" his deep, terrifying bark, causing all the children on his lawn to immediately scatter."
Guffaw,"A <i>guffaw</i> is a belly laugh: a laugh that bubbles up with good feeling and plenty of volume. At the end of a stressful day of work, it’s good to have some <i>guffaws</i> with your friends.<br><br><i>Guffaw</i> operates just like the word laugh: you can give a <i>guffaw</i>, or you can <i>guffaw</i>. It comes from the Scottish word <i>gawf</i>, which is onomatopoetic, meaning that it’s spelled the way it sounds. Imagine a big happy Scotsman snorting ""gawf, gawf, gawf"" at the end of a joke, and you’ll know what a <i>guffaw</i> is. Refined ladies and gentlemen don’t guffaw––and are much the worse for it."
Gyrate,"When things turn or spin on an axis, like the seats on a whirling amusement park ride, they <i>gyrate</i>. When you spin a top, you watch it <i>gyrate</i>.<br><br>An axis is a fixed, imaginary point or line that something rotates around — the Earth, famously, turns on an axis. If an object spins rapidly around this point, it gyrates. Many kinds of engines gyrate, and so do pinwheels, windmills, and gyroscopes. Even Elvis's hips were said to gyrate! The root of the verb <i>gyrate</i> is the Latin word for ""circle,"" <i>gyrus</i>, which in turn comes from the Greek <i>gyros</i>, ""circle or ring."""
Hackneyed,"<i>Hackneyed</i> is a word for language that doesn't pack a punch since it's overused and trite. ""Roses are red, violets are..."" — enough already?! That's hackneyed stuff.<br><br><i>Hackneyed</i> is usually used to describe tired writing, but you can also refer to the hackneyed plots of television sit-coms or the hackneyed jokes of your Uncle Fred. But, most often, you will see <i>hackneyed</i> before the word <i>phrase</i> to refer to a specific cliché that is annoying the heck out of someone."
Halcyon,"An old man watching his grandchildren play might look back fondly on his <i>halcyon</i> days, remembering the peaceful, happy time of his youth.<br><br>The word <i>halcyon</i> comes from a story in Greek mythology about the <i>halcyon</i> bird, which had the power to calm the rough ocean waves every December so she could nest. Like those calm waters, <i>halcyon</i> has come to mean a sense of peace or tranquility. People often use the phrase <i>halcyon days</i> to refer idyllically to a calmer, more peaceful time in their past."
Hangdog,"A <i>hangdog</i> look is one that betrays a feeling of shame, embarrassment, or fear. Your <i>hangdog</i> expression after sneaking a whoopee cushion onto your teacher's chair is a dead giveaway that you're guilty.<br><br>Use the adjective <i>hangdog</i> to describe someone's cowering appearance or the sheepish look on her face. You might have a hangdog look if you're afraid of getting in trouble, or if you regret your actions. The now-obsolete root noun <i>hang-dog</i> was used in the 17th century to mean ""a despicable, low person,"" or someone who's ""only fit to hang a dog,"" or sometimes ""only fit to be hung (like a dog)."""
Hapless,"Use the adjective <i>hapless</i> to describe someone unlucky and deserving of pity, like the <i>hapless</i> car buyer who gives in to the fast-talking salesperson.<br><br>The word <i>hapless</i> traces all the way back to the Old Norse word <i>happ</i>, meaning “chance, good luck.” Combine this with the suffix <i>-less</i> (“lacking”) and <i>hapless</i> means “unlucky” or “ill-fated.”  A traveler who goes to Moscow and briefly gets lost on the subway? Just a tourist. A traveler who goes to Moscow, accidentally eats food he is allergic to, somehow loses all his money, and by chance gets on a train destined for Mongolia? Definitely <i>hapless</i>."
Harbinger,"A <i>harbinger</i> is something that comes before and that shows what will follow in the future. The robin is a <i>harbinger</i> of spring––its presence means spring is coming soon.<br><br>The appearance of a ghost is often thought of as a <i>harbinger</i> of death. Middle English <i>herbergere</i> is from Old French <i>herbergeor</i> ""host,"" from <i>herberge</i> ""camp, shelter,"" a word ultimately borrowed from a Germanic language."
Hardy,"<i>Hardy</i> means tough––if you're <i>hardy</i>, you don't get tired easily and can endure hardship. People who don't catch cold often attribute this fact to their coming from <i>hardy</i> farming stock.<br><br>Before 1200, <i>hardy</i> indicated boldness and daring in battle and was probably influenced by <i>hard.</i> Warriors are <i>hardy</i>: they’re brave and strong and don’t easily tire. Plants and animals can also be <i>hardy</i> if they can survive harsh weather or poor growing conditions. When planting a lawn, you should pick hardy species of grass, which will survive droughts and come back after long, cold winters."
Harmonious,"Things that are <i>harmonious</i> go together nicely, like notes in music or people that work well as a team.<br><br>The idea of things being harmonious comes from music — when certain notes sound good together, they are harmonious. But this concept applies to many other things and people, too. You could say pieces of art that look good next to each other are harmonious. A basketball team that shares the ball and gets along well is harmonious. Anytime people get along, they're being harmonious. In a totally harmonious society, there would be no war or hate."
Hasten,"The verb <i>hasten</i> means to move at a high speed. If you <i>hasten</i> to your room, no one will know that you came in late.<br><br><i>Hasten</i> comes from the word <i>haste,</i> which means ""excessive speed or urgency."" The words <i>hurry</i> and <i>hasten</i> are synonyms. <i>Hasten</i> can also mean ""to make happen quickly,"" like when you open a window in the kitchen when you are cooking to hasten the room's cooling down. <i>Hasten</i> also means ""to be quick,"" like when you <i>hasten</i> to tell everyone that the rumor going around about you isn't true."
Havoc,"<i>Havoc</i> is a noun that means devastation or total mayhem. <i>Havoc</i> often wreaked by hurricanes, angry mobs, plundering Vikings, and wild parties that get out of control.<br><br>If we trace <i>havoc</i> way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people believe that the word comes from the Old French <i>havot</i>, meaning “plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed down to us from the Latin <i>habere</i>, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way you look at it, the meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or destruction."
Heady,"Something that's <i>heady</i> is extremely thrilling. You might have a <i>heady</i> feeling as you walk up on stage to get your high school diploma.<br><br>Use the adjective <i>heady</i> to describe a sensation that is so exciting it makes you a little dizzy, a bit like being intoxicated. You could talk about the <i>heady</i> scent of your mom's rose garden or the <i>heady</i> feeling of winning the state spelling bee. The fourteenth century meaning of <i>heady</i> was ""headstrong or impetuous,"" and it's sometimes still used in this way. By the 1570's, it had also come to mean ""apt to go to the head,"" or ""exhilarating."""
Hearsay,"Ever hear someone say something so juicy you decide to tell other people about it, even if you don't know if it's true or not? Admit it. That <i>hearsay</i>, or gossip, is precisely how rumors get started.<br><br><i>Hearsay</i> is one of those awesome words that tell us its definition right up front. You don't have to figure it out by hearsay, or word of mouth, the definition is right there — when you hear someone say a rumor, that's hearsay."
Hearty,"<i>Hearty</i> describes abundant, full, and satisfying things, and lively, strong, and enthusiastic people. A bowl of thick chili with cheese and a glass of milk is <i>hearty</i>. A spoon of water with a grape? Not so <i>hearty.</i><br><br>You can't miss the ""heart"" in <i>hearty</i>. Words like ""wholehearted"" and ""half-hearted"" also have ""heart"" and are a help in remembering the adjective <i>hearty</i>. If you put your whole heart into anything from walking a dog to saying good morning to your friends, you're hearty and full of life. Something half-hearted is weak and not hearty.  A loud laugh that fills a room is very hearty; you can almost feel its fullness. If it comes from the heart and adds well-being and happiness, it's probably hearty."
Heathen,"If you don't believe in God — or if you contradict other beliefs of a religion — you are a <i>heathen</i>.<br><br>There are plenty of nonbelievers, but a heathen is something more — someone who is actively offensive to a religion. The term is tied to the Gods of Judaism, Christianity and Islam; someone who rejects the various gods of Hinduism, for example, is not likely to be called a heathen. Heathens are sometimes called infidels and pagans. These days, the term is often used humorously. An atheist might jokingly refer to herself as a heathen."
Heedless,"Someone <i>heedless</i> is reckless or not paying attention. <i>Heedless</i> rhymes with needless, and someone who's <i>heedless</i> acts as if needed things are needless. If you head out to surf in a tsunami, you're <i>heedless</i> of the giant-wave warnings.<br><br>When you pay heed to something you pay attention to it or consider it, but if you’re <i>heedless</i> you do the opposite. Sometimes being heedless means being a risk-taker in an exciting way, or it can just mean losing track of time, but often it describes being inconsiderate. If you keep raising the volume when your brother asks you to turn down the music, you’re heedless of his need to study, and if you're heedless of the yellow tape that says ""Do not cross,"" you disregard the law."
Hefty,"Something that's <i>hefty</i> is big and heavy. When you have to lug a <i>hefty</i> suitcase around, it helps if it has wheels.<br><br>Hefty objects are large and bulky, and you can describe people as hefty when they're big and brawny and strong. When you buy a hefty bag of dog food for your hefty bull mastiff, you might want to ask a hefty young employee if she'll help you carry it to your car. <i>Hefty</i> comes from <i>heft</i>, which means both ""to lift"" and ""weight or heaviness."""
Heinous,"A <i>heinous</i> crime is very evil or wicked. Of course, some people only use the term as an exaggeration, claiming that their parents' requirement that they write thank you notes after their birthdays is a heinous form of torture.<br><br><i>Heinous</i> descends from Middle English, from Old French <i>haineus</i>, from <i>haine</i> ""hatred,"" from <i>hair</i> ""to hate."" So when you want to use the word heinous in all seriousness, think of acts that are considered hateful (or outrageous, and shocking). Think: treason, torture, the clubbing of baby seals. <i>Heinous</i> is pronounced HĀ-nəs."
Hermit,"You hear about <i>hermits</i> more often than you meet one, and that’s because a <i>hermit</i> is someone who likes to be alone, far from people, sometimes because of their religious beliefs or maybe because they simply want some privacy.<br><br>Hermits like living solo, alone in the woods, up in a mountain, or sometimes they live in a city without hardly ever leaving their apartment.  The root of the word is the Greek <i>erēmos</i>, meaning “solitary.”  A life of solitude isn’t for everyone, but a hermit chooses it for any number of reasons.  For example, being able to honor their religious beliefs more fully or hating all of humanity are two possible motivations to become a hermit."
Herring,"A <i>herring</i> is a small, silver fish. Most <i>herring</i> that's caught for food is prepared by being smoked, salted, or pickled.<br><br>The majority of herring is caught in the Atlantic, though the fish is found in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Because it's very high in the famously healthy Omega-3 fats, herring is considered a healthful fish for people to eat. Herrings is also used as bait for catching larger fish. Although the source of the word <i>herring</i> is uncertain, many experts see a link to the Old English <i>har</i>, or ""gray."""
Hiatus,"A temporary gap, pause, break, or absence can be called a <i>hiatus</i>. When your favorite TV show is on <i>hiatus</i>, that means there are no new episodes — not forever, just for a little while.<br><br>Even things that go on for a long time take a break once in a while: one kind of break is a hiatus. If someone has to leave her job for a time, she's going on hiatus. A touring band will need to take a hiatus if the lead singer gets in an accident. The key thing about a hiatus is that it's an interruption of something that was happening, but it's not a permanent break."
Hijack,"To <i>hijack</i> a vehicle is to take control of it by force. Chances are you've seen an action movie in which some villains <i>hijack</i> a car or plane.<br><br>To hijack a vehicle is to take it over illegally. Such a crime is called a hijack or a hijacking. <i>Hijack</i> can be used more generally to mean “take over.” If your friend has a bad habit of interrupting other people to talk about himself, you can say that he tends to hijack the conversation."
Hinterland,"The <i>hinterlands</i> are affectionately called ""the sticks,"" or the ""boonies,"" short for ""boondocks."" Use it to specify an area that is far away from a city or town, or even civilization as we know it.  Cell-phone reception and cable television aren't guaranteed.<br><br>The noun <i>hinterland</i> comes to the English language via Germany:  <i>hinter</i> is ""behind"" + <i>land</i> is, well, ""land."" It actually refers to the land lying inland — or behind — an ocean coast or river shore, which is why <i>backwaters</i>  and <i>hinterlands</i> are used interchangeably. Use <i>hinterlands</i> when you want to make fun of an area's backwardness, or to celebrate its natural beauty: ""Coming from the unspoiled <i>hinterlands</i> of Louisiana, she found it hard to adjust to the sights and sounds of the big city."""
Hoard,"To <i>hoard</i> is to save something (or lots of things) for future use. Squirrels <i>hoard</i> nuts for the winter. Old ladies tend to <i>hoard</i> canned food and used plastic bags.<br><br>People have been using the word <i>hoard</i> for both ""to hide"" and ""treasure"" for centuries; as both a verb and as a noun. Some hoard valuables, such as money, jewelry, and family antiques. Others build up a hoard, or cache, of things that aren't worth money but are important to them — like comic books or match books."
Holistic,"<i>Holistic</i> means encompassing the whole of a thing, and not just the part. <i>Holistic</i> medicine looks at the whole person for answers, not just at physical symptoms.<br><br>You might have heard of <i>holistic</i> medicine, which tries to treat someone as mind and body, instead of treating only the part of the patient that is most sick. People often talk about <i>holism</i> in relation to healing, whether of bodies or other things. A holistic approach to solving a labor dispute would take into consideration the needs of both the workers and the factory owners."
Hoot,"A <i>hoot</i> is the musical call an owl makes. The <i>hoot</i> of an owl sounds very much like the word <i>hoot</i>.<br><br>An owl's hoot is the inspiration for a similar sound that people make to show disapproval or scorn: ""The sound of the crowd's <i>hoots</i> filled the stadium when the soccer player kicked the ball into his own team's goal."" To make this sound, whether you're a person or an owl, is to <i>hoot</i>, and if you don't give a <i>hoot</i>, it means you really don't care at all."
Horrendous,"Bad luck, an injury, a mistake, an unfortunate outfit, or a crime — anything can be called <i>horrendous</i> if it causes such dread or fear that you can barely even think about it.<br><br>If you’ve ever encountered something horrendous, you won’t be surprised to learn that the word traces back to the Latin word <i>horrere</i>, meaning ""to bristle with fear, shudder."" That’s a good way to think about <i>horrendous</i> things — they cause you to shudder. You can use the word to describe any type of thing — people, ideas, actions, and so on — but save it for those things that are not merely bad but instead are truly horrifying."
Hunk,"A <i>hunk</i> is a piece or a chunk or a lump, something without a definite shape. You might eat a <i>hunk</i> of cheese or play with a <i>hunk</i> of clay. If you call someone a <i>hunk</i>, you think he’s hot.<br><br>For a casual dinner you might just grab a hunk of bread off the loaf and dip it in beef stew, which is full of hunks of meat and potatoes. A completely different type of hunk is a handsome man: ""When did your cousin turn into such a <i>hunk</i>?"" Hubba hubba! This second meaning dates from around 1945, from African American slang."
Hunker,"To <i>hunker</i> is to crouch: to bend your body into a low, small shape. When you're playing hide and seek, you may decide to <i>hunker</i> in the back of a closet until you're found.<br><br>You hunker physically when you're hiding or making space for other people or squatting to talk to a small child. You can also hunker figuratively, like when you hunker down in your house during a snowstorm, waiting to venture out until the roads have been plowed. Another way to hunker down is to focus on a task and work extra hard. We know <i>hunker</i> is a Scottish word, but beyond that its origins aren't clear."
Hurdle,"A <i>hurdle</i> is a barrier or other obstacle that a runner has to jump over during a race. If you trip on a <i>hurdle</i>, you probably won't win the race.<br><br>When they're doing certain types of races, both human and horse athletes have to leap across hurdles (sometimes other animals do this too, like dogs and even rabbits). To do this is also to <i>hurdle</i>. There are physical hurdles, and then there are their figurative counterparts — those difficulties or hurdles that prevent you from progressing in your life."
Hurl,"When you <i>hurl</i> something, you throw it hard. You might <i>hurl</i> your shoe at a horrible bug if it suddenly scuttled across the floor.<br><br>If you hurl a rock at a glass window, it will probably break, and if you hurl your trash in the direction of a garbage can, it may or may not land inside. The verb <i>hurl</i> implies some force behind your throw. The earliest English version was <i>hurlen</i>, which in the thirteenth century meant ""run against each other or collide."" It probably comes from the Germanic root <i>hurr</i>, which is also the root of <i>hurry</i>, and means ""rapid motion."""
Husky,"If your voice is low and gruff, it's <i>husky</i>. A deep, gravelly voice is <i>husky</i>, and you're <i>husky</i> if you have a large, muscled, heavy body. You might even be a <i>husky</i> person with a <i>husky</i> voice.<br><br>When <i>husky</i> is a noun, it's a northern breed of dog that's bred to pull a sled. Your Alaskan Husky could have a husky bark, and your voice might be the result of a bad cold, or it just might be the normal way you speak. The <i>husky</i> that describes a voice comes from <i>husk</i>, in the sense of ""dry as a husk."" The husky dog's root is from 1850s Canadian English, <i>hoskey</i>, ""Eskimo,"" or ""Eskimo dog."""
Ignominy,"If you walk into class in your underwear, you'll know what the word <i>ignominy</i> means. <i>Ignominy</i> is a noun meaning great public shame, disgrace, or embarrassment, or a situation or event that causes this.<br><br>The shame can be major or minor: to suffer the <i>ignominy</i> of defeat/the <i>ignominies</i> of old age. When pronouncing this word, the main accent is on the first syllable, and the secondary accent is on the third syllable. <i>Ignominy</i> is from French <i>ignominie,</i> from Latin <i>ignominia,</i> formed from the prefix <i>in-</i> ""no, not"" plus <i>nomen</i> ""a name."" The corresponding English adjective is <i>ignominious.</i>"
Illimitable,"Use <i>illimitable</i> to describe something that has no limits, like the universe, or your little brother's capacity for annoying you.<br><br><i>Illimitable</i> is a rare word — and a rather fancy one.  It's more common to say something's <i>limitless</i> or <i>measureless,</i> but <i>illimitable</i> is good if you want to sound literary or formal, say if you're talking about the ""illimitable power of human endeavor.""  If you use <i>illimitable</i> to describe something like your appetite for candy, it will sound kind of funny, which is perfectly fine as long as you're going for a laugh."
Imbibe,"<i>Imbibe</i> is a fancy word for ""drink.""  If you need to <i>imbibe</i> ten cups of coffee just to get out of the house, you might have a caffeine problem.<br><br>Although the verb <i>imbibe</i> means to take in liquids of any sort, if you don't specify the liquid, people are likely to infer you mean an alcoholic beverage.  You can also use it figuratively.  If you have imbibed every detail about every battle of the U.S. Civil War, you must find the subject interesting."
Imbue,"To <i>imbue</i> is to fill up with or become ""soaked"" in an idea or emotion, as a sponge takes in water. One visit to Africa might be enough to <i>imbue</i> ambitions in a medical student to return to heal the sick.<br><br>You can use <i>imbue</i> in a similar way as ""saturate,"" or ""soak through,"" to describe a filling or absorbing. A ""hue"" is a color, and it rhymes with <i>imbue.</i> When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way, colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from a spaghetti bowl, the color and the oil soak in. To fill people with qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or optimism."
Imminent,"Something that is <i>imminent</i> is just about to happen: if you light a firecracker and then stick it down your pants, a very bad situation is <i>imminent</i>.<br><br><i>Imminent</i> is from Latin <i>imminere</i> ""to overhang,"" and to say that something is imminent is to say that it is hanging over you and about to fall, in a metaphorical way. If you take your mom’s car and drive it into the mailbox, getting grounded is imminent. You don’t want that hanging over your head!"
Immolate,"<i>Immolate</i> is a verb that means to destroy something or someone, usually using fire, as a sacrifice to a higher cause.  Do not try this at home.<br><br>To protest the Vietnam War, some Buddhist monks would pour gasoline on their body, light a match, and immolate themselves, hoping that their fiery death would bring attention to the horror of war. The word comes from the Latin <i>immolare</i>, which means “sprinkled with sacrificial meal,” in reference to rituals where wheat grain would be sprinkled on the heads of human sacrifices. Immolation is a powerful statement, but talking it out is always a safer and less depressing option."
Immutable,"If you can't change it, it's <i>immutable</i>. There are many things in life that are immutable; these unchangeable things include death, taxes, and the laws of physics.<br><br>The adjective <i>immutable</i> has Latin roots that mean ""not changeable."" The Latin prefix for not is <i>in</i>, but the spelling changes when the prefix is put before the consonant <i>m</i>. It is <i>im</i> before a root word starting with <i>m</i> as in <i>immutable</i>. If you learn this rule, you'll know the immutable fact that immutable begins with <i>i</i>-<i>m</i>-<i>m</i>."
Impale,"The verb <i>impale</i> means to pierce an object with a sharp stick. When you're preparing shish kebabs, you <i>impale</i> chunks of marinated vegetables and meat on pointy metal skewers and then cook them on a grill.<br><br><i>Impale</i> comes from the Medieval Latin word <i>impalare</i>, which means ""to push onto a stake."" <i>Impale</i> can also mean to kill by piercing with a stake or spear. Legend has it that the only way to kill a vampire is to do exactly that: impale him with a wooden stake through the heart — and then stuff his mouth with garlic and chop off his head, too, just to be sure."
Impart,"Let me <i>impart</i> a little bit of knowledge to you about the word <i>impart</i>. It means to pass on, transmit, or bestow. If you share this with your study partner, you are <i>imparting</i> your new wisdom.<br><br>Studying imparts confidence as well as information, long life imparts wisdom, and anise seed imparts the flavor of licorice. Your mother can impart the importance of dressing neatly each and every day. Though it shares a root with the word <i>part</i>, <i>impart</i> doesn't mean to split into pieces, but rather to divide or share with another. Let me impart this message to you — always do your part!"
Impartial,"If you're in a contest you'd better hope the judges are <i>impartial</i>, that is, that they aren't biased toward one competitor over another.<br><br>When someone's <i>partial</i> to something they take its part. <i>Impartial</i> means no part has yet been taken. In most high school elections, teachers strive to create an impartial atmosphere, to keep it from appearing to be a popularity contest."
Impediment,"An <i>impediment</i> is anything that slows or blocks progress. It can refer to a physical thing, like a fallen tree in the road, or something more intangible, like how piracy is an <i>impediment</i> to the pleasure cruise industry in Somalia.<br><br>See the <i>pedi</i> in there? <i>Pedi</i> means ""feet"" and hundreds of years ago, the word <i>impediment</i> referred to shackling one's feet.  Now its use has broadened considerably. <i>Impediment</i> is something that blocks or impedes your path. There's no end to the things in your life that can be considered <i>impediments</i>: your small bank account, your terrible childhood, your country's economic malaise — any one of these could be considered an <i>impediment</i> in your quest for happiness."
Imperative,"When something absolutely has to be done and cannot be put off, use the adjective <i>imperative</i>.<br><br><i>Imperative</i> is from Latin <i>imperare</i> ""to command,"" and its original use was for a verb form expressing a command: ""Do it!"" is an <i>imperative</i> sentence. It's still used that way, but it's more commonly applied to something so pressing it cannot be put off: ""Hiring new workers has become <i>imperative</i>.""  It has more immediate force than <i>pressing</i> but less than <i>urgent</i>."
Impertinent,"If someone's rude without being openly nasty, like a kid in the back row of class quietly heckling his teacher, you can call him <i>impertinent</i>.<br><br><i>Impertinent</i> originally meant just what it sounds like, ""not pertinent, irrelevant,"" but it also came to mean ""inappropriate, out of place"" and therefore ""intrusive, presumptuous; behaving without proper respect; insolent."" It still carries a condescending air, so it's best used of or to a child being snippy to a grownup: ""Don't be impertinent!"" The stress is on the second syllable: im-PERT-inent."
Implacable,"An <i>implacable</i> person just can’t be appeased. If you really offended your best friend and tried every kind of apology but she refused to speak to you again, you could describe her as <i>implacable</i>.<br><br><i>Implacable</i> is derived from the verb to <i>placate</i>, which means to soothe, or to appease. If you’re babysitting and the kid starts screaming the moment that his parents leave the house, and nothing you give him, be it a toy or ice cream, can calm him down, he might seem implacable. But try the TV. It tends to turn screaming kids into silent, happy zombies."
Impose,"To <i>impose</i> means to force or inflict something on someone else. If you want to <i>impose</i> your musical taste on your parents, play your tunes all day at top volume.<br><br>The verb <i>impose</i> emerged in the 1580s, meaning ""to lay on as a burden,"" which is very similar to the modern meaning. Governments often impose taxes, legal restrictions, and other burdensome things on citizens, for example. But you should remember what Confucius once wisely said: ""Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire."""
Imposing,"<i>Imposing</i> is an adjective reserved for those things that are impressive in the sense that they are large or serious, as in the US Capitol Building or even, say, a professional wrestler.<br><br>When you look at the word <i>imposing</i> you see the word <i>pose</i>, which is useful in remembering what it means. A person who is imposing might strike a pose because they feel they have a lot to show. In fact, <i>imposing</i> is derived from the French verb <i>imposer</i>, which means ""to inflict."" Its French roots may inspire you to envision the enormous and expensive wigs worn by members of the French court. The larger the wig, the more imposing it was. And all the more reason to strike a pose!"
Imposition,"<i>Imposition</i> means you force something — usually an unwanted burden — on someone else. If your friends invite themselves over for dinner the night before your big test, that's an <i>imposition</i> because you'll have to cook instead of studying.<br><br><i>Imposition</i> comes from the 14th century Old French word of the same spelling, meaning ""the levying of taxes, a tax, duty."" Taxes are a good way to remember the meaning of <i>imposition</i>. You never want to pay taxes — but you have no choice but to pay. It can be the same for other kinds of burdens: if something is an imposition, you don't want to do it, but you likely will have to."
Impotent,"<i>Impotent</i> means lacking power or authority. Captain Bligh was <i>impotent</i> in the face of Christian's mutiny. It also refers to a man's inability to achieve or maintain an erection. If a man is sterile, or unable to reproduce, he is also called <i>impotent</i>.<br><br>Those wacky ancients really knew how to mess with you — simply add the prefix <i>im</i> to the front of <i>potent</i>, which means ""powerful,"" and you get its opposite — ""powerless."" While Viagra can help when the problems are physiological, an <i>impotent</i> leader has lost his ability to govern. No little blue pill will dig him out of that hole. It can also allude to a certain meaninglessness, such as the music critic who wrote that the easy listening genre of pop was so dull as to be ""the soundtrack to <i>impotence</i>."""
In toto,"If you believe a fortune teller's prediction about your future <i>in toto</i>, it means you accept the truth of everything he says. <i>In toto</i> means ""all together"" or ""without exception.""<br><br>Use the adverbial phrase <i>in toto</i> when you want a formal way to say ""entirely."" You might come across <i>in toto</i> in a legal document or a work of literature, or you could explain how you took your college adviser's recommendations in toto, and signed up for every class she suggested. <i>In toto</i> is Latin, from the root word <i>totus</i>, ""whole or entire."""
Incarcerate,"Use the verb <i>incarcerate</i> when you need to put someone behind bars in a big way, meaning, send them to prison, like those who, after being found guilty of a crime and sentenced, become <i>incarcerated</i>.<br><br>The word <i>incarcerate</i> entered the English language in the sixteenth century, tracing back to the Latin word meaning “imprisoned.” If you <i>incarcerate</i> people, that means you imprison them for a predetermined amount of time in a jail, prison, or a detention center. It’s good to know the meaning of <i>incarcerate</i>, but make sure you never get so close to it that you have firsthand knowledge of the word."
Incarnate,"<i>Incarnate</i> means “having a bodily form.” If you encounter someone who pulls off butterflies’ wings for fun, you might describe that person as “evil <i>incarnate</i>.”<br><br>The meaning of <i>incarnate</i> is precisely what its Latin roots suggest. The prefix <i>in-</i> means “in” and <i>caro</i> means “flesh,” so <i>incarnate</i> means “in the flesh.” The word can be used in positive or negative situations, but it always describes an unusual, possibly miraculous instance in which something that can’t normally be seen or touched assumes a bodily form. For example, the Christian religion was founded on the belief that Jesus was God incarnate."
Incendiary,"An <i>incendiary</i> device is a bomb. An <i>incendiary</i> statement is, ""You're ugly and stupid."" Both are likely to produce an explosion of one kind or another.<br><br><i>Incendiary</i> means more than flammable. It means explosive, in both a literal and figurative way. If you're a radical who changes the world by exciting people and makes as many enemies as followers, you're an incendiary figure. The speeches you give that rile people up are incendiary. The fires you set are also incendiary, and by setting them you are also likely to be called an incendiary — someone who burns things, more commonly known as an <i>arsonist</i>."
Incense,"<i>Incense</i> means both ""to make angry"" and a stick that burns slowly and emits a strong smell. If your new college roommate burns <i>incense</i> in your tiny dorm room, you might get <i>incensed</i> and storm out.<br><br>How can a word that means a substance that is burned for its sweet odor come to mean ""make very angry""? Both have to do with the idea of burning, and the Latin root <i>incendere</i>, ""to set on fire."" A stick of incense must be lit, or set on fire to release its smell. When you are incensed by something, such as your teacher slamming you with homework on the night of the prom, you feel like you are burning with anger."
Incentive,"If your mom wants you to mow the lawn but you don't feel like it, she might offer to treat you to ice cream after as an <i>incentive</i>. An <i>incentive</i> is something that stimulates you to take action or work harder.<br><br>This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin <i>incentivum,</i> from <i>incentivus</i> ""stimulating."" In Latin, <i>incentivus</i> meant ""setting the tune,"" from <i>incinere</i> ""to sing."" The related English verb is <i>incentivize</i>. The less common verb <i>incent</i> was first used in the early 1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon."
Inception,"The <i>inception</i> is the beginning. Since its <i>inception</i>, Wikipedia has been created by its users.<br><br><i>Inception</i> sounds like <i>conception,</i> but their meanings are distinct.  <i>Conception</i> usually refers to the moment of becoming pregnant. <i>Inception</i> refers more to the beginning, to entering upon an undertaking. <i>Inception</i> implies the start of a specific thing like a campaign or a company. Subsequent events take place after the inception. At the moment of conception, most women are at the inception of motherhood."
Incessant,"Something <i>incessant</i> continues without interruption. When you're on a cross-country flight, it's tough to tolerate the <i>incessant</i> crying of a baby.<br><br>In Latin, <i>cessare</i> means 'to stop,' so when you add the negative prefix <i>in</i>- you get a word meaning never stopping.  A near synonym is <i>continual</i>, but something <i>incessant</i> is more relentless; <i>ceaseless</i> is a closer synonym. It's rare to find <i>incessant</i> used in a positive way. Even incessant sunshine would grow boring."
Incorrigible,"Someone <i>incorrigible</i> seems to be beyond correcting, improving, or changing. When you talk about an <i>incorrigible</i> bully, you're saying they're always going to push other people around.<br><br>Even though <i>incorrigible</i> implies a person is kind of hopeless, it's often used as a light-hearted word. When we describe someone as an incorrigible flirt or as an incorrigible gossip, we mean that this is just the way they are, and it would be foolish to try and change them. If someone is just being obnoxious as usual, you could say ""You're <i>incorrigible</i>!"""
Incumbent,"An <i>incumbent</i> is an official who holds an office. If you want to run for congress, you're going to have to beat the <i>incumbent</i>.<br><br><i>Incumbent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>incumbens</i>, which means lying in or leaning on, but came to mean holding a position. It was first used in English for someone holding a church office, and then someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for political officials. In a race for mayor, the incumbent mayor faces a challenger. <i>Incumbent</i> also means obligation. It is incumbent upon you to do the dishes."
Indelible,"If something is <i>indelible</i>, you better hope you never regret it, like the <i>indelible</i> tattoo of the name of your favorite band or the <i>indelible</i> first impression it might give people you meet years from now, especially if your taste in music changes.<br><br>The adjective <i>indelible</i> describes something that can't be erased or removed, like marks made by an indelible marker, or an indelible moment you will never forget, like your first day of kindergarten or the first time you visit a new, exotic place. It comes from the Latin word <i>indelebilis</i>, meaning ""not able to be destroyed."""
Indispensable,"<i>Indispensable</i> is a strong adjective for something that you couldn't do without. If you have asthma and you're packing for summer vacation, your inhaler is <i>indispensable</i>, unless you enjoy gasping on the beach.<br><br>Something that is <i>dispensable</i> is something you could get rid of, like that box of yogurt covered dried zucchini snacks that's been in the pantry for a year. So if something is indispensable you couldn't possibly go without it, like salt, or for some people, coffee. Chocolate is indispensable for chocolate chip cookies, as is furniture for the adult hide-and-go-seek league."
Indulgence,"An <i>indulgence</i> is doing something that you enjoy even if it has negative consequences. Buying yourself something that you don't need, be it a cookie, video game, or diamond necklace, is an <i>indulgence</i>.<br><br>If you allow yourself to eat more chocolate cake or watch more TV than is really good for you, those are your little indulgences. If you spend your life savings on a trip to Tahiti, that’s a huge indulgence. If someone says to you, ""Grant me this indulgence,"" prepare for a long-winded story that tries to convince you of something. Long, long ago the Catholic Church sold something called ""indulgences"": pardons for sins."
Industrious,"If someone comments that you are very <i>industrious</i>, they are complimenting you for working hard and tirelessly. You can have the evening to yourself if you're <i>industrious</i> enough during the afternoon to get your homework and chores done.<br><br>The word <i>industrious</i> is closely related to the word <i>industry</i>, used for both the quality of being hardworking, “He is a model of industry,” as well as a field of business, ""the construction industry."" It might help to remember the Industrial Revolution, the time when machinery was introduced to the manufacturing world. If you're industrious, you work as hard as machines do!"
Inept,"A clumsy, incompetent person — or an ineffective action — is <i>inept</i>. When you're <i>inept</i>, you don't know what you're doing or just can't get it done.<br><br>Someone inept is bumbling, clueless, and ineffective. Inept people are dumb or clueless; they don't understand things. More than that, inept people are bad at what they do. An inept lawyer always loses cases. An inept figure skater wipes out on the ice. An inept postal worker loses mail and puts it in the wrong box. An inept person is downright bad at something. The opposite of <i>inept</i> is <i>competent</i>."
Inexcusable,"Something <i>inexcusable</i> doesn't have an excuse, justification, or reason. <i>Inexcusable</i> things are horribile and unforgivable.<br><br>Getting sick is an excuse for missing school. When an action is inexcusable, there is no excuse for it. Inexcusable actions and words don't have a justification. Also, this word is used for things that are just plain awful. Most people would say crimes like murder are inexcusable. If a good friend lied to you, you might consider that inexcusable. This is a harsh word for things that we can't forgive or condone."
Infatuated,"Think he has no faults? Blush when he walks by? You are <i>infatuated</i>. When you are <i>infatuated</i>, your crush is so severe that it's pretty darned foolish.<br><br><i>Infatuation</i> comes from the Latin <i>infature</i> which means ""to make a fool of."" You can be <i>infatuated</i> with a person, but you can also be <i>infatuated</i> with an idea: ""Nick was so <i>infatuated</i> with the idea of knighthood that he wore a suit of armor to the prom, and asked to be called 'Sir Nicholas the Brave.'"""
Infinitesimal,"When it's incalculably small, when teensy seems large compared to it, then it is <i>infinitesimal</i>. ""The equipment was so sensitive that even the <i>infinitesimal</i> dust molecules that swept in with the open door altered the readings.""<br><br><i>Infinitesimal</i> is such an extreme description of a microscopic something that the word is used as an exaggeration more often than to describe something actually quite small. ""The chances of Roxy going out on a date with Norbert were <i>infinitesimal</i>. She barely even knew he existed."" <i>Infinitesimal</i> has as its root <i>infinite</i> which usually conjures up thoughts of immeasurably large quantities or sizes. In this case <i>infinite</i> refers to something immeasurably small."
Infraction,"When you break school rules about gum chewing, you commit an <i>infraction</i>. An <i>infraction</i> is a petty crime or a minor breaking of rules.<br><br>When you think of the word <i>infraction</i>, think that your offence has just crossed the line into wrong. Something like a parking ticket is an infraction. When you commit an infraction, you're not knee deep in wrong, you've just dipped your toe into wrong to see what it feels like. A misdemeanor is a more serious crime such as theft, and murder is considered a felony, the most serious of crimes."
Ingratiating,"If someone in your class places an apple on your teacher's desk in an <i>ingratiating</i> manner, that means he's making a calculated move to suck up and win your teacher's favor.<br><br>The word <i>ingratiating</i> comes from a combination of the Latin prefix <i>in-</i> meaning ""in""  and <i>gratia</i> meaning ""favor, grace."" A person who is ingratiating is trying to get in the favor or grace of those around her. But the word doesn't always have to imply a sly attempt at winning others over, sometimes it can simply mean charming or agreeable. A person's smile can be ingratiating, winning people over simply with its charm."
Inordinate,"Something that's excessive or that goes way beyond normal limits is <i>inordinate</i> — like an overly obsessive love for chocolate or a fantasy football junkie who spends an <i>inordinate</i> amount of time checking his team.<br><br>The adjective <i>inordinate</i> is the exact opposite of ""reasonable"" and ""moderate."" In fact, when you call something inordinate, you're saying it's downright exorbitant and out of proportion. It's often used to describe abnormal amounts of time spent doing something — playing video games at work or canoodling with your girlfriend at school, for example. But as Oscar Wilde once said, “An inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of remaining young.”"
Insensate,"<i>Insensate</i> is a word to describe something without feelings or consciousness. Cars, computers, and stuffed animals are all <i>insensate</i> (though some of us occasionally project thoughts and personalities onto them).<br><br><i>Insensate</i> can also describe individuals who seem to lack the characteristically human emotions of kindness and generosity. A person who tears a stuffed animal out of the hands of a young child might be described as <i>insensate</i>. Another meaning of <i>insensate</i> is “lacking intelligence.” In short, <i>insensate</i>, in any sense of the word, is usually something that you don’t want to be."
Insipid,"Something <i>insipid</i> is lacking in flavor or interest. You'll probably find the generic poems inside of greeting cards <i>insipid</i>.<br><br><i>Insipid</i> comes from the Latin <i>insipidus</i>, the opposite of <i>sapidus</i> which means flavorful. Because spices and salts are left out, hospital food is usually considered insipid. The most common use of the word is in a metaphorical sense for dull or flat. You might think that your goody-two-shoes cousin is the most insipid girl you've ever met."
Insolent,"Someone who's <i>insolent</i> is either really doing her own thing, even if it goes against what everyone else is doing, or she’s mildly disrespectful.<br><br>That student in your class who is constantly snubbing the teacher, snorting when he gives assignments, and rolling her eyes when he reads passages aloud from your vocabulary textbook? Insolent, definitely insolent. There might be another student who adorns her school uniform with pins and ribbons, cuts her hair shorter than the dress code allows, and rolls her socks down. This student is also insolent, in the sense that she defies the rules."
Internalize,"If you feel anger, pain, fear or hurt but never show it, you <i>internalize</i> it — you keep it inside.<br><br>If you think about the prefix <i>inter-</i> which always indicated something within, you have the meaning of the adjective <i>internalize</i>, ""to keep or take something in."" It can be used in either a positive or negative way. If you are a debater who internalizes a topic, then you know it inside and out. On the other hand, you're not doing yourself any favors if you internalize your guilt."
Interpolate,"In math, to <i>interpolate</i> means to estimate the value of something given certain data. If you are looking at a chart that gives the level of pollutants in a lake on Jan. 1 and Feb. 1, you must <i>interpolate</i> the level for Jan. 15.<br><br>At a bake sale, if you check the cash box and look at how many cookies are left over, you can interpolate the results of your fundraiser. When you interpolate words into a text, you alter the text by adding words in. Scholars can identify the original text from material interpolated at a later date. If you are describing an author's work, you might want to interpolate a few examples of his writing into your description."
Intrinsic,"The <i>intrinsic</i> qualities of something have to do with its nature. An <i>intrinsic</i> quality of dogs is that they're loyal.<br><br>Anything intrinsic comes from within. Doing a job for only money is not intrinsic. Doing a job because you love it is intrinsic; the motivation comes from within. It's good to treat people as having intrinsic value. If you like someone for intrinsic reasons, then you have no other motivation. The opposite of <i>intrinsic</i> is <i>extrinsic</i>, for things that come from the outside instead of from the inside."
Inundate,"To <i>inundate</i> means to quickly fill up or overwhelm, just like a flood. Your bathroom could be <i>inundated</i> with water if the pipes burst, and hopefully your inbox is <i>inundated</i> with nice emails on your birthday.<br><br>Commonly used to refer to a deluge of water, <i>inundate</i> can also refer to an overflow of something less tangible, like information. Right before the holidays, toy stores are often inundated with eager parents scrambling to get the latest action figures and video games. Attempt to read the entire dictionary in one sitting and you'll inundate your mind with vocabulary. But you probably won't remember any of it tomorrow."
Inversion,"A reversal of position is called an <i>inversion</i>. If a bookstore's employees join together to purchase the store, there's an <i>inversion</i> of power: the employees become owners, and the former owners are their employees.<br><br>Reversing the normal order of words in a sentence is also an <i>inversion</i>, especially if the verb comes before the subject. This inversion happens naturally in questions like ""Are you happy?"" but in statements it can sound a bit like Yoda from ""Star Wars"" — ""Happy are you."" In weather terms, an <i>inversion</i> occurs when the air temperature near the ground is colder than the upper air temperature."
Inviolable,"Wedding vows and vault combinations that can’t be broken are considered <i>inviolable</i>. (Of course, divorce lawyers and bank robbers consider this a challenge.)<br><br>The word can refer to a physical structure (a fortress, for instance) or something more conceptual (human rights or morals, perhaps). <i>Inviolable</i> has changed little from its Latin origin of <i>inviolabilis</i>, which combines the prefix <i>in</i>- (meaning ""not"") with the verb <i>violare</i> (""to violate""). <i>Inviolable</i> turns up in religious settings too, usually in reference to texts or rites. In that context, it means ""sacred."" No surprise: the antonym of <i>inviolable</i> is <i>violable</i> (""accessible or penetrable"")."
Irascible,"If you're <i>irascible</i>, you get angry easily — perhaps blowing up in rage when someone brushes into you.<br><br><i>Irascible</i> comes from the Latin root <i>ira</i>, which means ""anger"" or ""rage,"" the same root that gives us  the word <i>ire</i>, ""anger."" The <i>-sc</i> in the middle of <i>irascible</i>, means ""becoming,"" so <i>irascible</i> doesn't just mean you're angry — it's got action built into it. If you're looking for a fight most of the time, then you're irascible — ready for the spark that's going to set you on fire."
Ire,"<i>Ire</i> is another word for ""anger."" So if you routinely steal your neighbor's newspaper, don't be surprised to be on the receiving end of his <i>ire</i>.<br><br><i>Ire</i> comes almost directly from the Latin word for anger, <i>ira.</i> While it means pretty much the same thing, <i>ire</i> usually stems from a specific grievance, rather than just general irritation with the world. And if you provoke someone's ire, you're probably going to feel their wrath. Shakespeare used both <i>ire</i> and <i>anger</i> in one famous sentence from his play ""Pericles"": ""Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!"""
Irreducible,"Something <i>irreducible</i> is as simple, basic, or straightforward as it possibly can be.<br><br>How a certain person grows up to be a genius is irreducible to the sum of her experiences and genetic material — it's not that simple. And you might say that you can't generalize about your favorite poet, that her brilliant work is irreducible to such simplification. <i>Irreducible</i> is a big word, but it basically just means ""you can't make it any simpler than this."""
Itinerant,"An <i>itinerant</i> is a person who moves from place to place, typically for work, like the <i>itinerant</i> preacher who moves to a new community every few years.<br><br><i>Itinerant</i> is pronounced ""eye-TIN-er-ant."" It might remind you of <i>itinerary</i>, the traveler's schedule that lists flights, hotel check-in times, and other plans. It's no surprise that both words come from the Latin word <i>itinerare</i>, meaning ""to travel."" <i>Itinerant</i> was first used in the 16th century to describe circuit judges who traveled to faraway courtrooms. Today, almost anyone can be an itinerant."
Itinerary,"An <i>itinerary</i> is your travel plan — where you will go and when you will be there.<br><br>If you make plans to fly to Paris from Beijing or take a train to Chicago from Mexico City, you will need an <i>itinerary</i>. That means you will have a plan that displays how you will get from point to point in your travels and when you will be at each point. This word comes from the Middle English <i>itinerarius</i> and is defined as being ""about a journey."" <i>Itineraries</i> can be really useful because if you give your mother yours, she will always know where you are!"
Jab,"When you <i>jab someone</i>, you poke that person. No one on the school bus wants to sit next to the kid who tends to <i>jab</i> people in their ribs with his sharp elbows.<br><br>You might accidentally jab a man on the elevator with your umbrella, or jab your annoying brother on purpose when he's talking with his mouth full at dinner. Another kind of jab is a quick, sharp punch, especially the kind you make in martial arts. The word comes from the Scottish <i>job</i>, ""to strike, pierce, or thrust,"" which in turn is rooted in the Middle English <i>jobben</i>, ""to jab or thrust."""
Jargon,"<i>Jargon</i> usually means the specialized language used by people in the same work or profession. Internet advertising jargon includes the terms ""click throughs"" and ""page views.""<br><br>This noun can also refer to language that uses long sentences and hard words. If you say that someone's speech or writing is full of <i>jargon</i>, this means you don't approve of it and think it should be simplified. In Middle English, this word referred to chattering, so its origin is probably imitative: it echoes the sound of chatter or meaningless words."
Jaundice,"<i>Jaundice</i> is a medical condition that causes a slight yellowing of the skin. Many newborn babies are diagnosed with slight <i>jaundice</i> and need to spend time in the sunlight every day for a few weeks.<br><br>A patient with jaundice looks a little yellow, a condition that's caused by excess pigmentation due to deficiencies in the liver or bile duct. One common medical cause of jaundice is hepatitis, a liver condition. Another meaning of <i>jaundice</i> is the distortion of opinions due especially to envy or resentment: ""I hope my winning another acting award won't <i>jaundice</i> your feelings about being in plays."" The Latin root is <i>galbinus</i>, ""greenish yellow,"" a color once associated with bitterness and envy."
Jerky,"Something that's <i>jerky</i> has a bumpy, lurching kind of rhythm, like a <i>jerky</i> off-road ride in a jeep. Another kind of <i>jerky</i> is dried meat. You could chew your beef <i>jerky</i> to calm yourself on that <i>jerky</i> ride.<br><br>A jerky carnival ride starts and stops abruptly, and a jerky old movie might be choppy and shaky. When <i>jerky</i> is a noun, it's a dense, chewy type of dried meat. This second kind of jerky is an American word, adapted from the Spanish to originally be <i>charqui</i>, from an Incan root word, <i>ch'arki</i>, literally ""dried flesh."""
Jettison,"<i>Jettison</i> means to push to the side or toss away. If a boat is leaking or an airplane is running out of fuel, you can buy more time by <i>jettisoning</i> cargo, or throwing it overboard.<br><br>The word <i>jettison</i> — dating, in its nautical meaning, from the 15th century in English — is commonly used figuratively as well as literally. You can jettison a friendship or an attitude. During the month that the Winter Olympics are aired on TV, figure-skating fans across the country jettison homework and other responsibilities in order to watch."
Jiffy,"A <i>jiffy</i> is a brief amount of time — an instant, or a split second. When you're really tired at the end of a long day, you probably fall asleep in a <i>jiffy</i> after lying in bed.<br><br><i>Jiffy</i> is an informal word that can substitute for ""quickly"" or ""in the blink of an eye."" A speeding taxi will get you to your destination in a jiffy, and a really well-trained dog will come in a jiffy when you call her name. Not much is known about the origin of <i>jiffy</i>, other than the fact that it was once ""thieves' slang"" for ""lightning."""
Jocular,"Do you like to make a lot of jokes? Are you often silly? Are you usually happy? If so, then you are a <i>jocular</i> person.<br><br>Being <i>jocular</i> has to do with being both jokey and fun. A jocular suggestion is not a serious suggestion — it's a joke. Some people are more jocular than others: anyone who is ultra-serious and always frowning is not jocular. A comedian makes a job of being jocular. Class clowns can't stop being jocular, though the teacher might just see them as obnoxious. Being jocular is usually considered a good thing: it's not just about making a lot of jokes; it's about being happy and pleasant to be around."
Juxtapose,"See the word ""pose"" in <i>juxtapose</i>? When you <i>juxtapose</i>, you are ""posing"" or positioning things side by side.<br><br>The verb <i>juxtapose</i> requires contrasting things placed next to one other: ""The collage <i>juxtaposed</i> pictures of Jane while she was growing up and as an adult."" <i>Juxtapose</i> is used often when referring to contrasting elements in the arts. ""The music <i>juxtaposed</i> the instrumentation of jazz with the harmonies of soul."""
Lacerate,"The verb <i>lacerate</i> means to cut or tear. So the envelope that gave you that nasty paper cut? It <i>lacerated</i> your finger.<br><br>Something usually needs to be sharp or jagged to lacerate you, like broken glass or a sharp stick. You won't be getting lacerated anytime soon by lace or cotton balls, that's for sure. But watch out for sharp-tongued people hurling hateful words your way; those snide remarks and personal digs can lacerate feelings like a knife slicing through butter."
Lacquer,"<i>Lacquer</i> is a clear liquid that is painted on a surface and dries hard and shiny. <i>Lacquer</i> can be used to protect wood.<br><br>Wooden furniture or art objects made from wood are sometimes coated with lacquer. The lacquer makes the wood glossy and protects it from scratches and nicks. In Eastern Asia, there is a tradition of making decorative objects called ""lacquerware,"" boxes, buttons, and other items that are made of wood and coated in lacquer. <i>Lacquer</i> comes from a now-obsolete French word, <i>lacre</i>, a type of sealing wax, and is ultimately rooted in the Sanskrit <i>laksha</i>, ""red dye."""
Lambaste,"To <i>lambaste</i> is to reprimand or berate someone severely. People <i>lambaste</i> those who have angered or disappointed them.<br><br>Have you ever watched a basketball game and noticed a coach yelling like a maniac at a referee? That coach is lambasting the referee. Lambasting is also called chewing out, taking to task, scolding, reprimanding, berating, bawling out, and chiding. Parents lambaste disobedient kids. A boss might lambaste a worker who is late all the time. Lambasting is severe and goes way beyond criticizing. When you are lambasting, you are furious at someone and letting them know it."
Lament,"If you are really upset or sorry about something, you might <i>lament</i> it. A <i>lament</i> is full of regret and grief.<br><br>If you lament something, then you feel sorry about it. You could lament a mistake you made, or you could lament a horrible thing that happened to a friend. Also, a lament is an expression of grief. So if you keep saying how sorry you are about something, someone could say, ""Enough of your <i>laments</i>!"" There's also an old literary form called ""a <i>lament</i>,"" which expresses feelings of loss in a long dramatic poem."
Languor,"When you are sick or heartbroken and too tired to get out of bed, the listlessness you feel is called <i>languor</i>. It's sluggishness and slowness, but usually with cause.<br><br>The more commonly used word <i>languish</i> is closely related to <i>languor</i>. If you are languishing or becoming weaker, you are showing languor. Remember that <i>languor</i> implies a heaviness or slowness where there should be lightness or speed. There is no time for languor if you have an exam tomorrow, and you are just beginning to study now. And, a 100 degree day with 70% humidity can inspire languor in just about anyone."
Larceny,"<i>Larceny</i> is the legal term for stealing. Grand <i>larceny</i> is when you take something worth a lot of money, petty <i>larceny</i> when the stolen item is worth relatively little.<br><br><i>Larceny</i> is used when talking about stealing someone's property in regards to the law. If you illegally download music or plagiarize a text, that may be theft, but it is not larceny because there was no physical property involved. If you take a friend's yoyo and don't give it back, it's stealing — unless your friend calls the police and has you arrested on charges of larceny."
Larder,"When your mother buys groceries, she puts them in the <i>larder</i> or the pantry. A <i>larder</i> is a room or cabinet where you store food.<br><br><i>Larder</i> is an old-fashioned word, created back when people used lard — rendered animal fat — to grease pans and cook food. The larder is where they kept their bacon and their lard. Now it's where you keep your potato chips and your cookies."
Larynx,"The <i>larynx,</i> or ""voice box,"" is the cartilaginous structure at the top of the trachea, or ""windpipe,"" which is in your throat. The <i>larynx</i> contains the vocal cords.<br><br>The Greek word <i>laryngos</i> means ""the upper windpipe."" The <i>larynx</i> does all sorts of important things besides housing the vocal cords (which are actually folds, not cords). The larynx is involved in breathing, and it also helps keep food from entering your windpipe when you swallow. All mammals have one — the wolf that howls, the lion that roars, and Tarzan, who makes that — whatever that sound is he makes."
Lascivious,"Use <i>lascivious</i> to describe a person's behavior that is driven by thoughts of sex. If someone gives you a <i>lascivious</i> smile, they've got only one thing in mind.<br><br>Latin-based <i>lascivious</i> and the Old English word <i>lust</i> both share the same Indo-European root <i>las-</i> ""to be eager, wanton."" The much older word <i>lust</i> originally meant ""desire, pleasure"" and over time developed to mean sexual desire. <i>Lascivious</i>, on the other hand, entered the English language in the early 15th century complete with the meaning ""lewd, driven by sexual desire."""
Laud,"To <i>laud</i> someone doesn't mean to give them knighthood, but to praise them extravagantly — usually in a very public manner. Being <i>lauded,</i> of course, can have the same tonic effect as having been made a lord.<br><br>Fun fact: the word <i>laud</i> is related to the drug <i>laudanum,</i> a potent combo of alcohol and opium first invented in the sixteenth century. Its creator, the alchemist Parcelsus, clearly knowing the effect it had on people, took its name from the Latin word <i>laudere,</i> meaning ""to praise."" Not surprisingly, it remained one of the world's most lauded drugs until its use became strictly controlled in the early twentieth century."
Laudable,"Use the word <i>laudable</i> to describe something that deserves praise or admiration, like your <i>laudable</i> efforts to start a recycling program at your school.<br><br>When you break apart the word <i>laudable</i>, you can see the verb <i>laud</i>, meaning praise or acclaim, followed by the suffix <i>-able</i>, which is a tip-off that this word is an adjective. So <i>laudable</i> describes things that are worthy of praise, such as a <i>laudable</i> effort to end poverty, and it can also describe admirable ideas or beliefs, such as a <i>laudable</i> compassion for others."
Laudatory,"<i>Laudatory</i> has to do with praise. If you do great things, then you've done praise-worthy acts and people will use <i>laudatory</i> words when talking about you.<br><br>We all probably do something laudable at some point. If you play baseball well or just keep your room clean, then you probably receive laudatory words of encouragement. If I say, ""Your dog is the cutest, nicest pooch in North America,"" I am saying laudatory things about your dog. When you see <i>laudatory</i>, think praise."
Leer,"A <i>leer</i> is an unpleasant facial expression. A <i>leer</i> means the person doesn't like you, or even worse, does — in a creepy way.<br><br><i>Leer</i> can also be used as a verb, meaning ""to look at someone with a suggestive or rude expression."" Dirty old men might leer at every girl who walks by, but another reason to leer is to show scorn, like a dirty look your enemy gives whenever you enter the room."
Leery,"You can use the adjective <i>leery</i> to describe someone who's suspicious of a person or situation. After his brother came out with bald spots and uneven patches of buzz-cut hair, he was leery of having the same barber get near his own head.<br><br>Being <i>leery</i> is being distrustful. If you're leery, it will probably show on your face and in your posture. You may squint and wrinkle your brows or take a few steps back. If you're leery that someone won't keep a secret, you won't confide in them, and if you're leery about whether they'll keep a promise to you, you won't count on them. Sometimes people are leery because of some proof, but often, just having a bad feeling or instinct is enough to make a person leery."
Legacy,"Use the word, <i>legacy,</i> for something handed down from one generation to the next. A retiring company president might leave a <i>legacy</i> of honesty and integrity.<br><br><i>Legacy</i> comes from the Latin verb, <i>legare</i> ""to appoint by a last will, send as an ambassador."" Originally, the noun meant ""ambassador"" or ""envoy"" but soon shifted to mean the money and property a person leaves behind in his will. Many university scholarships are funded by the legacies of former students. In recent usage, political leaders are said to be concerned with their legacies, the historically significant achievements of their tenure in office."
Lethargy,"Is your pet slug always this comatose, or is this display of <i>lethargy</i> unusual? The word <i>lethargy</i> describes inactivity or a lack of energy.<br><br><i>Lethargy</i> comes from the Greek <i>lethargos</i>, originally meaning “inactive through forgetfulness.” Somewhere along the way, the word lost the implication of “forgetfulness” and just ended up hanging around in bed all day. Still, <i>lethargy</i> doesn’t necessarily imply laziness; it can be brought about by illness and may also describe a lack of strength. Other lethargic nouns include <i>torpor</i>, <i>sluggishness</i>, and <i>languor</i>."
Levity,"Joking that your dead grandmother ""never looked better"" could inject some <i>levity</i>, or frivolity, into her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.<br><br><i>Levity</i> literally means ""lightness,"" and it's often an attempt to inject some lightness or humor into an otherwise somber situation. Telling your Aunt Edna a joke while she recuperates from a skiing accident could provide the levity needed to brighten her mood. Yet <i>levity</i> is often used to describe humor that's not appropriate to the occasion, like telling your Aunt the joke, ""Two corpses walk into a bar..."" after her husband has just died."
Liaison,"Employ the French-sounding word <i>liaison</i> to refer to a relationship, a link between people or groups who aids communication.<br><br>There are two main definitions for <i>liaison</i> that stem from Old French and before that, the Latin word for ""to bind."" The first definition refers in general to a connection or a relationship that serves effective communication. The second definition refers more specifically to an illicit relationship, or an affair, and can have a negative connotation."
Lieu,"To be in <i>lieu</i> of something is to replace it or substitute for it. A restaurant that's run out of clams might serve French onion soup in <i>lieu</i> of chowder.<br><br>The word <i>lieu</i> originally comes from the Latin <i>locus,</i> meaning ""place,"" and its meaning has stayed true to its origins ever since. Though it does have a standalone definition, ""the position or function formerly held by another,"" this noun is most commonly encountered in the phrase ""in lieu of,"" which means, basically, ""instead of."""
Lithe,"Have you ever seen people who can bend so easily, they can touch their heels to the back of their heads? That person is, in a word, <i>lithe</i>.<br><br><i>Lithe</i> comes to us from Old English and originally meant ""mild, meek."" As a meek person bends to the will of others, the meaning of <i>lithe</i> has broadened to flexible and even graceful. Think of a dancer or the ease of a sleek cat when you think of <i>lithe</i>. You can use it to describe a person or the way someone moves."
Litigious,"If the haunted house staff treats you with extra care and don't subject you to the worst frights, it might not be because they like you, but because they know you're <i>litigious</i>: you tend to sue people.<br><br><i>Litigious</i> is the adjective form of <i>litigation</i>, the act of suing someone in court. If a person is called <i>litigious</i> that means they tend to sue people, maybe excessively. If you think that there are too many lawsuits, you think that a litigious culture is not good, but if you think it's important for people to demand compensation for other's people's negligence, then maybe you appreciate litigious behavior."
Livid,"If you're <i>livid</i>, you're furious, in a black cloud of anger. The Latin root this word comes from means ""bluish-gray"" or ""slate-colored,"" and you can also use <i>livid</i> to describe the color, such as a <i>livid</i> bruise or a <i>livid</i> sea.<br><br><i>Livid</i>, even when it means ""bluish-gray,"" has the sense of something not quite right. If the sky is <i>livid</i>, there's something ominous about it. Similarly, if your skin is <i>livid</i>, there's something wrong — you're either covered with bruises or you're at death's door, anemic and ashen. But <i>livid</i> is used most often to describe fury. What if you waited in line 15 hours and the person in front of you got the last seat for the hottest concert of the summer? You'd be <i>livid</i>!"
Loath,"If you are <i>loath</i> to do something, you really don't want to do it. If you are reluctant to go swimming, people will say you are <i>loath</i> to swim, but if they are really mean — they may throw you in anyway.<br><br>The adjective <i>loath</i> is used to describe being extremely opposed to something. The term is generally followed by <i>to</i> — ""The teacher was <i>loath</i> to let the students turn in papers late, but he made an exception for the girl who had missed class due to illness."""
Loathe,"If you <i>loathe</i> someone or something, you hate them very much. You might not choose to eat raw carrots if you dislike them, but if you <i>loathe</i> them, you might have a hard time even having them on your plate.<br><br>This word suggests a strong feeling of disgust. Near synonyms are <i>abhor</i> and <i>detest.</i> The verb <i>loathe</i> descends from Middle English <i>lothen</i>, from Old English <i>lāthian</i>. The related adjective <i>loathsome</i> means ""hateful or disgusting,"" and the adjective <i>loath</i> means ""not willing to do something,"" as in ""I'm <i>loath</i> to cheat on a test, but I don't see what choice I have."""
Locution,"Your southern-born friend's habit of saying ""y'all"" when she's talking to her family could be described as <i>locution</i> — it's a word she habitually uses in particular situations.<br><br>A person's style of speech — certain words or phrases she tends to use — is her <i>locution</i>, especially if it's specific to a particular place or group of people, like teenagers or French Canadians. You can also use the noun <i>locution</i> when you're talking about the way a person pronounces words. If someone tends to ""beat around the bush,"" or tell a story in a roundabout way, you can call that <i>circumlocution</i>."
Lore,"<i>Lore</i> is a body of knowledge or tradition that is passed down among members of a culture, usually orally. It's the <i>lore</i> in ""folklore,"" and responsible for spreading the word on mythical figures like Santa Claus, Paul Bunyan, and even Uncle Sam.<br><br>Most lore begins as an oral tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and only later takes on a written form. We tend to think of lore as something centuries-old, as in the British ""Arthurian <i>lore</i>"" surrounding the doings of the mythical King Arthur and his court. However, newer lore — such as baseball lore —  is constantly springing up. Humans need and love their lore."
Lucid,"Something that's <i>lucid</i> is clear and understandable. <i>Lucid</i> writing is important in journalism, so that readers easily get the point of the article they're reading.<br><br>When what you write or say is lucid, it's straightforward and its meaning is crystal clear. You can also use the adjective <i>lucid</i> to describe your mind or thoughts when you're thinking in a rational, sensible way: ""I was worried about my grandmother's confusion yesterday, but she seems really <i>lucid</i> today."" Another meaning is ""translucent,"" or letting light shine through — which makes sense since <i>lucid</i> comes from the Latin <i>lucidus</i>, ""light or clear,"" with its root of <i>lux</i>, ""light."""
Ludicrous,"<i>Ludicrous</i> things are funny, absurd, or nonsensical. If someone says something silly or far-fetched, you could say ""That's <i>ludicrous</i>!""<br><br><i>Ludicrous</i> originally meant something that was funny, playful, or joking: a ludicrous comment was just a really funny comment. Over time, <i>ludicrous</i> took on a more negative flavor. Now a ludicrous statement might be funny, but it's also ridiculous, hard to believe, off the wall, or even stupid. When people say 
""That idea is ludicrous!"" it usually means the idea could never happen: the notion is laughable. Saying Neil Armstrong was the third President would be a ludicrous statement."
Lug,"To <i>lug</i> something is to drag or haul it. If you have to <i>lug</i> a heavy backpack to school, look into buying a fashionable backpack on wheels.<br><br>If you overpack for a trip, you might end up having to lug your suitcases around the airport, and if your grocery bag breaks on your way home, you'll have to lug your gallon of milk and bunches of bananas in your arms instead. As a noun, <i>lug</i> has several less common meanings, including ""a handle-like projection,"" and ""an asymmetrical four-sized sail."" Informally, a <i>lug</i> is also an ear in Scotland, and a bully in North America."
Lurid,"When people are lured into looking at something, they may be drawn to it because it's a shocking, graphic, or horrible scene, something <i>lurid</i> and very vivid that pulls them in. Your mother might complain that she hates <i>lurid</i> TV shows — ones that are overly sensationalized and meant to shock.<br><br>An expression used to avoid hearing or seeing disturbing things is ""spare me the <i>lurid</i> details"" or ""spare me the gory details,"" and people say that so they won't have shocking or ugly images put into their imaginations. The word <i>lurid</i>, which entered English in the 17th century, comes from Latin <i>lūridis,</i> ""ghastly, pale yellow."" All of the synonyms for the adjective <i>lurid</i> describe qualities that can turn a person pale: dreadful, nightmarish, and horrific, among others. <i>Lurid</i> is just a uniquely dark and gruesome word."
Magnanimous,"A <i>magnanimous</i> person has a generous spirit. Letting your little sister have the last of the cookies, even though you hadn't eaten since breakfast, would be considered a <i>magnanimous</i> act.<br><br><i>Magnanimous</i> comes from Latin <i>magnus</i> ""great"" and <i>animus</i> ""soul,"" so it literally describes someone who is big-hearted. A person can show that over-sized spirit by being noble or brave, or by easily forgiving others and not showing resentment.  It implies superiority, and is something you should say of others rather than of yourself. Being magnanimous doesn't require doling out tons of cash — just being an understanding and tolerant soul will do the trick."
Majestic,"<i>Majestic</i> things display great dignity, befit a great ruler, or are simply far superior to everyday stuff. Compared with a peasant's hut, for instance, a king's palace is quite <i>majestic</i>.<br><br>The adjective <i>majestic</i> has origins in the Latin word <i>majestatem,</i> meaning ""greatness, dignity, honor, or excellence."" It's often used to describe things connected with kings and queens (whom, you'll remember, we often address as ""Your Majesty""). We also like to refer to the great creatures and places of the natural world as majestic: Mt. Fuji in Japan for example, or a bald eagle flying over the Grand Canyon."
Malcontent,"A <i>malcontent</i> is someone who's always dissatisfied.  The guy at the restaurant who sends back the steak because it's too rare, then sends it back a second time complaining that it's not rare enough — he's a <i>malcontent</i>.<br><br><i>Malcontent</i> is often used to describe people who complain about more important things than steaks — things like social and political injustice. In Shakespeare's day, the Malcontent was a popular character type. Hamlet was a classic Malcontent.  He believed that his uncle, King Claudius, murdered his father for power, and it made him angry that everyone else seemed to think that Claudius was a good person."
Malfeasance,"Whenever you see the prefix ""mal-,"" you know it's not good. <i>Malfeasance</i> is bad behavior, especially from officials or people who should know better.<br><br>If nothing else, the <i>mal-</i> in <i>malfeasance</i> will alert you to the fact that something bad is going on. If you know French, <i>fease-, faise-</i> will ring a bell, as it often means ""to do."" You can probably then infer that <i>malfeasance</i> means ""to do bad."" Today, it's usually a bad deed done by an official or an organization. You wouldn't accuse a dog who peed on the carpet of malfeasance, but you would accuse a mayor who took a bribe of malfeasance."
Manifold,"<i>Manifold</i> is a smarty-pants way to say ""varied,"" ""many,"" or ""multiple."" There are many good reasons to expand your vocabulary, so you could say the benefits of learning new words are <i>manifold</i>.<br><br><i>Manifold</i> sounds like ""many fold,"" which is what it is — something with many features, like a wallet with lots of folds so stuffed with junk that makes you sit funny when it's in your back pocket. As an adjective, <i>manifold</i> loves to appear in books, like Mrs. Gryce in Edith Wharton's ""The House of Mirth,"" whose ""domestic duties were manifold."" As a noun, a <i>manifold</i> is a pipe branching into many openings, often found in car engines."
Mar,"A <i>mar</i> is a flaw, mark, or blemish, like a deep scratch on a wooden table. As a verb, to <i>mar</i> is to make such an imperfection — like the pen mark that <i>mars</i> your crisp, white shirt.<br><br>We often think of things that mar as immediately noticeable, like scratches, scars, and blemishes, but sometimes <i>mar</i> describes other ways of ruining something. For example, an unexpected run-in with a difficult person can mar your relaxing day at the beach, just as an unpleasant memory can mar a peaceful state of mind. The thing to remember is, it only takes one scratch, one mean comment, or one negative experience to mar something that is otherwise fine."
Marsupial,"Like primates, <i>marsupials</i> are a type of mammal. One thing all members of this family have in common is a pouch.<br><br>The most famous marsupial is the kangaroo, but there are many others, such as wallabies, opossums, koalas, and wombats. What makes marsupials different from primates or rodents (who are also mammals) is that the mothers have pouches to hold their young. This is because when marsupial babies are born, they're not quite ready for the world, so the pouch gives them a chance to grow and be safe before having to live on their own. When you think <i>marsupial</i>, think ""pouch."""
Martyr,"Someone who suffers, or is even killed, for his or her political or religious beliefs is called a <i>martyr.</i><br><br>Martin Luther King Jr. is often called a martyr in connection with the American civil rights movement. A martyr is also someone who chooses to be put to death rather than renounce his or her religious beliefs, as the story of Saint Stephen tells. In the figurative sense, if you are a martyr to headaches, you suffer from them. Sometimes, <i>martyr</i> is used negatively to refer to someone who chooses to suffer when there is no need to do so."
Maven,"Whether it's in fashion, or food, or forensic science, someone who really knows his stuff about a topic is a <i>maven</i>, or a person particularly skilled in the field.<br><br>The word <i>maven</i> comes from the Yiddish <i>meyvn</i>, meaning ""one who understands."" But to be a maven you have to more than just understand a topic, you have to know its ins and outs. Often mavens are the people that you turn to as experts in a field. You don't become a maven overnight. That kind of expertise comes with an accumulation of knowledge over the years."
Meander,"To <i>meander</i> means to wander aimlessly on a winding roundabout course. If you want some time to yourself after school, you might meander home, taking the time to window shop and look around.<br><br><i>Meander</i> comes from a river in modern-day Turkey, the Maiandros, which winds and wanders on its course. Today, a stream or a path meanders, as does a person who walks somewhere in a roundabout fashion. If your speech meanders, you don't keep to the point. It's hard to understand what your teacher is trying to impart if he keeps meandering off with anecdotes and digressions. Pronounce <i>meander</i> with three syllables not two — me-AN-der."
Meek,"The adjective <i>meek</i> describes a person who is willing to go along with whatever other people want to do, like a <i>meek</i> classmate who won't speak up, even when he or she is treated unfairly.<br><br>A meek person can also be humble, but these words aren't quite synonyms. If you are humble, you don't want a lot of attention, like the humble athlete who has a truly excellent performance yet after the game, tells reporters that it was group effort by the whole team. A meek person, on the other hand, would never think a reporter would ever want to talk to him or her, and if asked, would probably try to get someone else, someone more ""worthy,"" to do it."
Menial,"A <i>menial</i> task is anything that takes very little training, skill, or talent. Some people find it relaxing to do the menial chore of folding laundry.  Go figure.<br><br>The adjective <i>menial</i> comes from an Old French word, <i>mensie</i>, which means “household.”  Many chores that get labeled as <i>menial</i>  are domestic, but other jobs outside of the home are sometimes also considered <i>menial</i>: stuffing envelopes, data processing, repetitive assembly line work, brain surgery (OK, that last one is <i>not</i> considered <i>menial</i>; we were just checking to see if you were awake)."
Mince,"To <i>mince</i> is to chop into tiny bits. Your favorite soup recipe might include directions to <i>mince</i> four cloves of garlic.<br><br>When you dice an onion into very small pieces, you mince it, and when you grind meat very fine to make sausage or mincemeat, you also mince. Another meaning of the verb is to soften, or to express something in a gentle way: ""She does <i>mince</i> her words when she talks to shy kindergarteners."" The Old French root, <i>mincier</i>, means ""make into small pieces,"" and it comes from the Latin word for ""small,"" <i>minutus</i>."
Miscreant,"A <i>miscreant</i> is a person who is bad––who lies, breaks the law, yells at small puppies. It's a somewhat old-fashioned word, popular with old ladies shocked at having their purses stolen at the opera.<br><br><i>Miscreant</i>, like <i>lout</i>, <i>lecher</i>, <i>good-for-nothing</i> — they're the words proper people use to condemn the improper. Improper people consult an entirely different thesaurus of condemnation, perhaps familiar to you but not possible to quote from in this PG-rated word blurb."
Misdemeanor,"A <i>misdemeanor</i> is a minor offense, rather than a serious crime. A minor infraction like keeping a library book for years or stealing a pack of bubblegum would be considered a <i>misdemeanor</i>.<br><br>A crime like murder is serious, a felony that can land the person who commits it in jail for a long time. A <i>misdemeanor</i>, on the other hand, is a far less serious offense. Commit a misdemeanor such as petty theft, and you might not get more than a slap on the wrist."
Mitigate,"Choose the verb <i>mitigate</i> when something lessens the unpleasantness of a situation. You can <i>mitigate</i> your parents' anger by telling them you were late to dinner because you were helping your elderly neighbor.<br><br>The somewhat formal verb <i>mitigate</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>mītis</i> ""soft"" and <i>agere</i> ""to do/act,"" which add up to ""to soften."" It is often used with words that indicate an outcome or something harmful. When you buy car insurance, you are trying to mitigate the risks involved with driving. Sunscreen is used to mitigate the effects of the sun on your skin."
Modicum,"If you want to describe a small amount of something, try <i>modicum.</i> If you have a <i>modicum</i> of interest in something, you are a little bit interested.<br><br><i>Modicum</i> comes from the Latin <i>modicus,</i> for moderate, and <i>modus,</i> for measure. We often use it to mean ""any at all,"" as if ""If you had a <i>modicum</i> of sense (i.e. any sense at all), you'd be able to see that the pencil you've spent the last five minutes looking for is tucked behind your ear."""
Monotonous,"When something goes on and on and on and on and on, the same way, for a long time, that's <i>monotonous</i>. <i>Monotonous</i> things are boring and repetitive, like that long story you've heard your brother tell a hundred times before.<br><br>Ever hear a song that just sounds like the same thing over and over? Ever hear a dog that keeps barking all day? Or a voice that's dull and unchanging in tone? All those things are monotonous: they don't change much, and they're dull as dishwater. Anything tedious or humdrum is probably monotonous. If someone says you're being monotonous, try to vary your tone of voice or the things you're talking about."
Moribund,"Something that is <i>moribund</i> is almost dead, like a <i>moribund</i> economy that has been stuck in a recession for years.<br><br>In Latin, <i>mori</i> means ""to die."" You probably recognize this root in words like <i>mortal</i>, <i>mortician</i>, and <i>mortuary</i>. <i>Moribund</i> means ""near death,"" but it can also mean something that is coming to an end, nearly obsolete, or stagnant. For example, as streaming videos over the Internet becomes a more and more popular way to watch movies and television shows, the DVD has become a <i>moribund</i> medium."
Morose,"A <i>morose</i> person is sullen, gloomy, sad, glum, and depressed — not a happy camper.<br><br>When someone is morose, they seem to have a cloud of sadness hanging over them. This word is stronger than just <i>sad</i> — <i>morose</i> implies being extremely gloomy and depressed. We all can be morose at times, like after the death of a friend or family member. Whether you're morose due to an event or just because you're feeling blue, you should try skipping or whistling a little tune to perk things up."
Mortify,"To <i>mortify</i> someone is to cause them extreme embarrassment. Your mother may not have been trying to <i>mortify</i> you when she showed up at your senior prom with a bunch of unicorn balloons, but she did.<br><br>The root of the verb <i>mortify</i> is from the Latin word <i>mors</i>, which means “death.” To mortify something used to mean to destroy its life, but now <i>mortify</i> is mostly used when you feel so ashamed or embarrassed you “want to die.” To punish yourself through deprivation from food or another desire, you can mortify that compulsion, but it’s probably best to just mortify your parents by showing up at their work place with a new mohawk."
Mousy,"If your house is painted the same dull brown color as a mouse's fur, you can call it <i>mousy</i>. If you're tired of your <i>mousy</i> hair, you can always dye it purple.<br><br>If you think of mice as shy and boring, you'll understand the sense of the adjective <i>mousy</i>. Whether it's describing a color, like your mousy brown sweater, or a personality, like a timid, mousy classmate, <i>mousy</i> is rarely a compliment. The ""quiet and unassertive"" meaning is the oldest, dating from about 1812, while the reference to color came along forty years later."
Mundane,"An ordinary, unexciting thing can be called <i>mundane</i>: ""Superman hid his heroic feats by posing as his <i>mundane</i> alter ego, Clark Kent.""<br><br><i>Mundane</i>, from the Latin word <i>mundus</i>, ""world,"" originally referred to things on earth. Such things were supposed to be uninteresting when compared to the delights of Heaven; hence the word's present meaning. Writing about reality TV shows, a <i>Newsweek</i> writer opined, ""In reality bizarro-world, the <i>mundane</i> is presented as the spectacular"" — in other words, people's everyday routines are now televised as entertainment."
Myopia,"<i>Myopia</i> is nearsightedness, which means you see things more clearly that are closer to your eye.<br><br>You probably suffer from myopia if you walk into the living room and notice the chair in front of you but not the chair ten feet away. If you have myopia, things farther away look out of focus. Also, this can mean narrow-mindedness and intolerance. Due to the first kind of myopia, someone might always hold the menu two centimeters from their eyeballs at restaurants. Due to the second kind, someone might avoid people with different opinions from their own."
Nary,"Use the adjective <i>nary</i> to mean ""none,"" or ""not a single one."" If you hope for a snowy morning, when you wake up you'll be sad to see <i>nary</i> a snowflake.<br><br><i>Nary</i> is an old fashioned and informal way to say ""not."" You might describe your friend's sad, empty book shelves with nary a novel on them, or your bald great uncle, who has nary a hair on his head. The word has been around since the mid-1700s, from <i>never a</i>, which was then shortened to <i>ne'er a</i>, and finally <i>nary</i>."
Nautical,"If it can go to sea, it’s <i>nautical</i>.  That is, if it has to do with a boat, ship, sailor, or one of those maps of the ocean that nautical people call a <i>chart</i>, it can be considered <i>nautical</i>.<br><br>You can wear khakis with sailboats or whales embroidered all over and not be the least bit nautical, but if you know that a rope is called a <i>sheet</i> and that <i>hard to the lee</i> means “duck and move to the other side of the boat,” there’s hope.  The most nautical among us know what knot to tie in any given boating situation, which makes them both nautical and “knot-ical.”"
Nefarious,"Describe a person's actions as <i>nefarious</i> if they are evil or wicked. Batman and Superman are always fighting evildoers and stopping their <i>nefarious</i> plots.<br><br><i>Nefarious</i> comes from the Latin <i>nefas</i> ""crime, impiety."" If something is nefarious, it is criminal, evil, malicious and wicked. Thinking of superheroes can help you remember the meaning of the word, but it is often used in much less exciting circumstances. News reporters investigate corrupt politicians in order to uncover the nefarious activities. And, if you don't pay for your downloaded music, you have gotten it by nefarious means."
Negligible,"When something is meaningless or insignificant because it is so little, it's <i>negligible</i>. The amount of interest you'll get on your savings is <i>negligible</i>, so you might as well spend your money.<br><br>If you work really hard on something, but the praise you get for it is negligible, you won't try so hard next time. Besides meaning very small, <i>negligible</i> can mean unimportant or not worth paying attention to. If you get into a fender-bender, you've gotten into a car accident with negligible damage. School concert programs always offer a word of thanks to the principal and other members of the administration whose role in the concert seems to be negligible."
Neophyte,"A <i>neophyte</i> is someone who's brand new at something. You're a <i>neophyte</i> the first time you pick up a guitar and start learning to play.<br><br><i>Neo-</i> means new, and <i>-phyte</i> is from the Greek <i>phuton</i> ""plant""––like a baby plant, a <i>neophyte</i> is someone who is new to an activity. In Greek, <i>neophytos</i>, literally ""newly planted,"" was used to mean ""new church convert."" A political neophyte is someone who is newly elected and comes to Washington D.C. not understanding how the game of politics is played. A Frisbee neophyte is someone who has just thrown the disc for the first time."
Nigh,"<i>Nigh</i> is an old-fashioned word that can be used as an adjective or adverb to mean near or nearly. Something that is <i>nigh</i> impossible — like knitting a sweater in one night — will be very difficult to accomplish.<br><br>As an adjective, <i>nigh</i> is an older form of the word ""near,"" both of which are rooted in the Old English word <i>neah</i>. People like to use the word <i>nigh</i> when they talk about the apocalypse: ""Repent! The end is <i>nigh</i>."" It's most common to use <i>nigh</i> today when you're trying to sound poetic or referencing the archaic or biblical uses of the word."
Notorious,"Use the adjective <i>notorious</i> to describe people, places, or things that are famous for a bad reason.<br><br>A good synonym for <i>notorious</i> is <i>infamous</i>; both words mean ""well-known, and not in a good way."" A celebrity convicted of a series of crimes might be referred to as <i>notorious</i>, as might a book that has been banned in several countries. The word originally meant just ""famous"" and could carry either positive or negative connotations. Only in recent centuries did the negative uses start to outweigh the positive ones. In general, you'd rather be <i>famous</i> than <i>notorious</i>, unless you're looking to build a bad reputation."
Obeisance,"An <i>obeisance</i> is an act, usually physical, showing dutiful obedience. A supplicant might perform <i>obeisance</i>, touching his face to the ground, before humbly asking for help.<br><br><i>Obeisance</i> is often used in historical or religious contexts and often refers to bowing or kneeling. Figuratively, it means an act of respect though sometimes with the negative connotation of slavishly doing as expected. Your boyfriend might bring you and your mother flowers in obeisance to the idea that the parents should be courted as much as the child. Consumers who want this software must show obeisance to the Internet — it can't be bought in a store or anywhere else."
Obfuscate,"Some people are experts at <i>obfuscating</i> the truth by being evasive, unclear, or obscure in the telling of the facts. The people who are good at <i>obfuscating</i> would include defense lawyers and teenagers asked about their plans for Saturday night.<br><br>Although the verb <i>obfuscate</i> can be used in any case where something is darkened, less clear, or more obscure, it is most frequently used in reference to things like ideas, facts, issues, or the truth. The usual implied meaning is that this obfuscation is done deliberately. Politicians often obfuscate the truth about the issues to win support for their positions so they can win elections."
Obituary,"An <i>obituary</i> is the notice of someone's death. It is placed in the newspaper to alert others to the death. It gives a background about the deceased's life, usually listing survivors and giving funeral information.<br><br>The noun <i>obituary</i>, which appears in English in the early 18th century, comes from the Latin <i>obīre</i>, where <i>ob-</i> means ""toward,"" and <i>īre</i>, ""to go,"" suggesting a ""going toward"" one's death. The first obituary as we know it probably appeared shortly after the invention of the printing press and included just the bare facts of the death. In 19th-century England, the announcements became more elaborate, and photos were added in the 20th century, making the modern obituary more like an elaborate eulogy."
Obligatory,"<i>Obligatory</i> describes something you do because you have to, not because you want to. When you buy a car, you have to fill out the <i>obligatory</i> forms. In many homes, saying please and thank you is <i>obligatory</i>.<br><br><i>Obligatory</i> derives from the verb <i>oblige</i>, as in ""after she was so nice, I felt obliged to take her a present."" Some people feel burdened by lives of common <i>obligation</i>, giving presents, returning phone calls, eating birthday cake, attending religious services––none of which they feel any real desire to do."
Obscene,"<i>Obscene</i> describes something that is morally offensive in a sexual way. It's never a good idea to use <i>obscene</i> language at school.<br><br>Certain films, books, magazines, and other forms of entertainment are considered <i>obscene</i> because they portray sex in a very frank way that some people find vulgar and lewd. Obscene material, language, and jokes are considered taboo in polite society. <i>Obscene</i> can also be used to describe something repulsive — like when your friend ate an obscene number of snails at the Bastille Day bash."
Obsequious,"If you disapprove of the overly submissive way someone is acting — like the teacher's pet or a celebrity's assistant — call them by the formal adjective <i>obsequious</i>.<br><br>There are many words in the English language for a person or an action that is overly obedient and submissive. Obsequious people are usually not being genuine; they resort to flattery and other fawning ways to stay in the good graces of authority figures. An obsequious person can be called a bootlicker, a brownnoser or a toady. You can also say that someone gives an obsequious bow, a gesture that means, ""your wish is my command."""
Obstinate,"When someone is beyond stubborn, use the word <i>obstinate</i> instead: ""You <i>obstinate</i> old mule! Get out of my way!""<br><br>While <i>stubborn</i> may have positive or negative connotations, <i>obstinate</i> is most definitely negative, because it implies a kind of hard-headed determination not to change your mind even when it might be best to rethink your position. ""The obstinate Man does not hold Opinions, but they hold him,"" wrote Samuel Butler way back in the seventeenth century. The word still does the trick if you want a put-down for someone you think is being a pig-headed fool or a stick in the mud."
Obtuse,"The adjective <i>obtuse</i> is good for describing someone slow on the uptake: ""Don't be so <i>obtuse</i>: get with the program!""<br><br>The adjective <i>obtuse</i> literally means ""rounded"" or ""blunt,"" but when it's used for a person, it means ""not quick or alert in perception"" — in other words, not the sharpest tool in the shed. It's not just for dull people, but also dull angles: in geometry, an obtuse angle is one that is not so sharp (between 90 and 180 degrees)."
Obviate,"To <i>obviate</i> means to eliminate the need for something or to prevent something from happening. If you want to <i>obviate</i> the possibility of a roach infestation, clean your kitchen regularly.<br><br>The prefix <i>ob</i> means ""to go against.""  That makes sense when you look at the words <i>obstruct</i> and <i>obstacle</i>, but how about <i>obstetrics</i>? Why does the name of the branch of medicine dealing with birth have the same root as words that mean ""stop"" or ""get in the way""? Because a midwife stands opposite to, or against, the woman giving birth."
Odious,"If something is <i>odious</i> it's hateful. If you become a historian of slavery, you'll learn all the details of that <i>odious</i> trade.<br><br><i>Odious</i> is from the Latin noun <i>odium</i>, which means hatred. It is a strong word, so don't call someone odious unless you want to accuse someone of being loathsome or vile. Actions can also be called odious. A typical use is Shakespeare's in <i>Othello</i>: ""You told a lie, an odious damned lie."" Some synonyms are <i>hateful, contemptible, detestable,</i> and <i>abominable</i>."
Omnipotent,"If you want to describe someone who can do absolutely anything, reach for the adjective <i>omnipotent</i>.<br><br><i>Omnipotent</i> comes from the Latin words for total (<i>omni</i>) and power (<i>potent</i>).  <i>Omnipotent</i> is frequently used for deities, but can apply to any exaggerated description of power. If you think that love rules the world, then to you, love is omnipotent. On the other hand, if you think that brute force wins, then maybe your idea of an omnipotent person is a mob boss. The stress is on the second syllable: om-NIP-uh-tent."
Onerous,"If one teacher gives you three hours of homework a night, that's rough. But if all of your teachers do it, that makes the task of completing your homework an <i>onerous</i> one, to say the least. If something is <i>onerous</i>, it is very difficult to deal with or do.<br><br>A near synonym is <i>burdensome</i>. In legal usage, <i>onerous</i> describes a contract or lease that has more obligations than advantages. <i>Onerous</i> derives from Middle English, from Old French <i>onereus</i>, from Latin <i>onerōsus</i>, from <i>onus</i> ""burden."" In English, an <i>onus</i> is a task or duty that is <i>onerous,</i> or very difficult."
Oodles,"When you have <i>oodles</i> of something, you have a whole lot of it. If you have a big bowl of spaghetti, then you can say that you have ""<i>oodles</i> of noodles.""<br><br>Use the informal <i>oodles</i> when you mean ""lots,"" ""tons,"" or ""bunches."" If you grow up to have oodles of money, you can buy a huge house with oodles of space for the oodles of puppies you plan to adopt. Of course, you also imagine having oodles of dog nannies to take care of the puppies and clean up after them. <i>Oodles</i> is an American English word that first turned up in nineteenth century Texas."
Ooze,"The beauty of the word <i>ooze</i> is not only that it's both a noun and a verb but also that the word sounds like what it means. The <i>ooze</i> on the bottom of the pond <i>oozed</i> between your toes.<br><br>When something oozes, it seeps out slowly in an unappetizing way. Cheese sauce oozes out of the container. Sludge oozes out of a treatment plant. Cream oozes out of a tube. Whatever is oozing is referred to as <i>ooze</i>. After an oil spill, a cleanup crew has to clean up the ooze that collects on the shore. It can also be used to describe someone's behavior if it's especially awful. A person who is really bad, for example, can be said to ooze evil."
Opalescent,"If you're familiar with the way that the gemstone opal shimmers like a pearl, then you'll understand that something <i>opalescent</i> reflects the light in the same way.<br><br>Opal is a beautiful mineral with an almost magical, layered reflective quality that catches the eye the way a pearl does. Something opalescent has that same reflective quality. High-quality guitars, for example, often have opalescent inlays in the fingerboard that are not only beautiful but also useful. They can help the guitar player find her way around the instrument. Don't be fooled by imitations! Many fake jewels have an <i>opalescent</i> quality that mimics real pearl, but it's plastic, all the same."
Opulent,"<i>Opulent</i> is a word that you will hear a lot around rich people looking to show off. ""Remember the <i>opulent</i> buffet at Carrie’s sweet sixteen? Sixteen chocolate cakes iced in gold leaf!""<br><br>If you want to remember that <i>opulent</i> is a word describing lavish displays of wealth, you can think of the word <i>opal</i> to help you remember it––opal being a rare gem. And if you are lucky enough to be able to afford opulence yourself, don’t describe it that way. The word contains connotations of <i>pretentious</i>. And gold leaf cake aside, who wants that?"
Ordination,"What an inauguration is to a president, an <i>ordination</i> is to a religious authority. It's the ceremony of bestowing a person with a position of religious authority — as when someone becomes a priest, minister, or shaman.<br><br>The noun <i>ordination</i> comes from the Latin word <i>ordinare</i>, meaning “put in order.” Becoming a religious leader usually requires training in a seminary followed by an ordination. On the other hand, the ordination of a monarch is a ceremony in which a King’s or Queen’s divine right to rule the country, which was historically considered a birth right, is asserted and initiated without any seminary courses required."
Ornery,"To be <i>ornery</i> is to be grumpy and hard to please. Oscar the Grouch? Definitely <i>ornery</i>.<br><br>The adjective <i>ornery</i> sprung up in the early 19th century when people started pronouncing <i>ordinary</i> with an accent.  The root of <i>ordinary</i> is the Latin word for “order,” and if you disrupt the orderly existence of an ornery person, prepare to get yelled at.  A person can have a consistently ornery personality, or maybe you’re feeling ornery today because you skipped breakfast.  Some synonyms for <i>ornery</i> are <i>cantankerous</i> and <i>crotchety</i>, words that sound as grumpy as the people they describe."
Osculate,"To <i>osculate</i> is to kiss or touch with your lips. If you <i>osculate</i> your dog on the mouth, some of your family members will laugh while others will be disgusted.<br><br>The kind of kiss you give when you osculate is by definition either a goofy one or an almost exaggeratedly formal one, like a dapper gentleman who kisses a lady's hand. There is also a mathematical definition of <i>osculate</i>, which is almost like a math kiss: when two surfaces or two curves touch in at least three points. The Latin root word is <i>osculum</i>, kiss, or literally little mouth."
Ostensible,"When something is <i>ostensible</i> it appears to be the case but might not be. Research for a role is the <i>ostensible</i> reason for Nat's drinking. But I think it's because he just likes to drink.<br><br>Just because something is ostensible doesn't necessarily mean that it's not as it appears to be, only that there's a possibility of another reason. My ostensible reason for calling Brent was to ask about work. The real reason was that I was hoping he might ask me out. Turns out both the ostensible reason and the real reason were true!"
Ostentation,"<i>Ostentation</i> is a pretentious or showy display (gaudy or flashy), usually designed to attract attention. Ostentation is a woman in a fur coat, covered in diamond jewelry, boarding a gold-plated private jet.<br><br>The noun <i>ostentation</i> stems from the Latin word <i>ostentationem,</i> meaning ""vain display."" It is often associated with material items that showcase one's wealth and luxury. <i>Ostentation</i> might come to the minds of the other parents if you drive a Lamborghini to drop your kids off at school. A movie star's gas-guzzling, 400-foot yacht may also be considered by many as a symbol of ostentation."
Oust,"A teacher may <i>oust</i> you from class if you are being disruptive, or you might <i>oust</i> your class president from her position if you beat her in the election. To <i>oust</i> is to “expel,” “kick out,” or “remove and replace.”<br><br>When you oust someone, you are “giving them the boot.” A sports team is <i>ousted</i> from a tournament if they lose an elimination round. <i>Oust</i> often implies both removal and replacement. The automobile, for instance, ousted the horse as the preferred means of travel. Likewise, when a politician ousts someone from office they are taking that person’s place in office. And if you beat the all-time record in a hot-dog eating tournament, then you oust the previous record holder from their position."
Overhaul,"To <i>overhaul</i> is to completely renovate, making major changes in order to repair. A few shutters and a new coat of paint won't come close to fixing that old, boarded-up house — it needs a complete <i>overhaul</i>.<br><br>Back in the 1620s when the word was coined, <i>overhaul</i> described examining a fishing net to make sure there were no tears or big holes that would keep the fisherman from getting a big haul, or large amount of fish. Today, an overhaul is usually the result of such a close examination — like the overhaul that some people want to make to American public schools, or the overhaul an old car needs to keep it on the road."
Panacea,"If someone offers you a pill that promises eternal life, don’t take the pill.  It’s a <i>panacea</i>, a remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.<br><br>The Greek word <i>pan</i> means “all” (think of a <i>pan</i>orama, a view where you can see everywhere).  The Greek word for “cure” is <i>akēs</i> (which looks like the word “aches”).  Those are the roots of <i>panacea</i>, a cure for all aches.  But a panacea doesn’t really cure everything; it just acts like it can.  Use the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone rich, or a robot that does your homework for you."
Paraphrase,"The verb <i>paraphrase</i> means to sum something up or clarify a statement by rephrasing it. So to <i>paraphrase</i> that explanation, it means to say something in other, simpler words.<br><br>If you break <i>paraphrase</i> down, you end up with the prefix <i>para</i>, meaning ""beside,"" and the word <i>phrase</i> — so think of <i>paraphrase</i> as coming up with similar, more simple phrases that go beside the ones already said. You might <i>paraphrase</i> your teacher’s lesson because you want to simplify her complicated technical language, or because you forgot exactly what she said but remember the general meaning."
Pare,"To <i>pare</i> is to trim — like when you <i>pare</i> branches on a tree or <i>pare</i> down your expenses to save money.<br><br><i>Pare</i> comes from the Latin word <i>parare</i>, meaning ""to prepare.""  Think of peeling potatoes, which you might do with a paring knife, or paring your nails so you'll make a neat appearance. In each case, you are trimming something gradually. If you pare down your expectations, you might be pleasantly surprised."
Parlance,"The noun <i>parlance</i> means the manner of speaking and using words. Your 15-year-old will tell you that you are definitely not fluent in the <i>parlance</i> of teenagers, no matter how cool you think you are.<br><br><i>Parlance</i> comes from the French word <i>parler</i>, meaning ""to speak."" The noun is often used to refer to the jargon or slang a certain group or industry uses. If you work in the sciences, you'll be familiar with the parlance of scientists and be familiar with such jargon as ""goodness of fit"" and ""iff"", which means ""if and only if"". But if you are not a scientist, you may stumble when you first come across such terms."
Parochial,"If an issue or a matter is <i>parochial</i>, it is trivial or only concerns a local area. Likewise, a person with a <i>parochial</i> mentality is narrow-minded, or not open to new ideas.<br><br><i>Parochial</i> comes to English from Greek through Latin with the meaning ""of a parish."" As a parochial school is a school that is affiliated with a particular church, the connection is easy to see. In general though, <i>parochial</i> refers to a narrow or limited point of view — that is, an outlook that extends no further than the limits of the parish. You may feel that there is no room in your life for the parochial attitudes of the older generation. Let's hope you remain open-minded as you age!"
Parsimonious,"A <i>parsimonious</i> person is unwilling to spend a lot of money. You know those people who count up every penny when it's time to split a restaurant bill? You can call them <i>parsimonious</i>. Or cheap.<br><br><i>Stingy</i> is the most common and general synonym, but there are many other near synonyms: <i>thrifty, frugal, penurious, niggardly, penny-pinching, miserly, tight-fisted, tight.</i> The adjective <i>parsimonious</i> was formed in English from the noun <i>parsimony</i> ""the quality of being careful in spending"" (from Latin <i>parcimonia,</i> from <i>parcere</i> ""to spare"") plus the suffix <i>–ous</i> ""having the quality of."""
Pathos,"<i>Pathos</i> is a quality that stirs emotions. A song with a lot of <i>pathos</i> hits you right in the heart.<br><br>You ever notice how some songs or movies appeal to your brains, while others appeal to your feelings? The ones that are all about feeling are full of pathos, an appeal to emotions that originally meant ""suffering"" in Greek. Often, this word has to do specifically with pity and sympathy: when someone tells a story about people suffering that makes you feel for them, that's pathos."
Pauper,"<i>Pauper</i> is an old-fashioned word for someone who is poor — really poor, like the <i>paupers</i> described by Charles Dickens or Mark Twain.<br><br>The noun <i>pauper</i> has been around for over 500 years, but today, the word tends to mostly crop up in literature. If people use it in conversation, they tend to use the word self-deprecatingly. ""I'm sorry, I can't afford to go with you to the movies. I'm living like a <i>pauper</i> this week, until I get paid."""
Peal,"A <i>peal</i> is a loud or deep sound that is usually repeated. So, you may hear a <i>peal</i> of laughter or a peal of <i>thunder</i>, but you wouldn't refer to a solitary scream as a <i>peal</i>.<br><br>You'll often notice the regular, repeated peal of church bells — in fact, they sometimes peal on the hour. In the fourteenth century, a <i>peal</i> referred specifically to church bells, in fact. The word is a shortened version of <i>appeal</i>, from the idea that the bells ""summon"" or ""call "" worshippers to the church. In contemporary times, <i>peal</i> is more often used to describe more commonly repeated sounds — like barking, laughter or thunder."
Pedantic,"There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is <i>pedantic</i> makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details.<br><br><i>Pedantic</i> means ""like a pedant,"" someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of Chinese porcelain kitty-litter boxes."
Peevish,"When you're <i>peevish</i>, you're easily irritated and grumpy. Everything seems to get under your skin.<br><br>Know someone who always seems annoyed, grumpy, cranky, or irritated? That person is peevish. Some people are peevish in general, but most people can be peevish about certain subjects — we all have a pet peeve. Lots of people get peevish about language: like using the word <i>like</i> all the time as verbal filler. Being peevish is almost always considered a form of pettiness — it's not a good thing. When you're peevish, you're not really looking at the big picture."
Pejorative 1.,"Call a word or phrase <i>pejorative</i> if it is used as a disapproving expression or a term of abuse. Tree-hugger is a <i>pejorative</i> term for an environmentalist.<br><br>Coming from the Latin word for ""worse,"" <i>pejorative</i> is both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it means disapproving or disparaging. Hack is a pejorative term for a bad writer. If you call someone a politician in the pejorative sense, you mean that they are scheming and out for personal gain. Terms of abuse such as jerk and negative euphemisms such as bottom feeder are pejoratives, words you use when you want to call someone a bad name."
Pejorative 2.,"Call a word or phrase <i>pejorative</i> if it is used as a disapproving expression or a term of abuse. Tree-hugger is a <i>pejorative</i> term for an environmentalist.<br><br>Coming from the Latin word for ""worse,"" <i>pejorative</i> is both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it means disapproving or disparaging. Hack is a pejorative term for a bad writer. If you call someone a politician in the pejorative sense, you mean that they are scheming and out for personal gain. Terms of abuse such as jerk and negative euphemisms such as bottom feeder are pejoratives, words you use when you want to call someone a bad name."
Pellucid,"A sentence that teaches a new vocabulary word should always be <i>pellucid,</i> that is, its style and meaning should be easily understandable so that you can derive the definition from the sentence.<br><br>You may have heard the word <i>lucid</i>, which means clear. Both <i>lucid</i> and <i>pellucid</i> derive from a Latin word that means ""to shine through."" Pellucid water is clear, a pellucid sky is a particularly intense shade of blue, pellucid prose is writing that's easy to understand, and pellucid singing is clear and light in tone."
Penance,"<i>Penance</i> is the act of doing a good deed to make up for past wrongs. Shoveling your neighbor's sidewalk all winter could be your <i>penance</i> for not helping rake the leaves that dropped from your tree into his yard during the fall.<br><br>Although the noun <i>penance</i> can mean any remorse for past mistakes, or any voluntary action meant to right the wrong, <i>Penance</i>, with a capital <i>P</i>, also specifically refers to a sacrament in the Catholic Church. When a person receives Penance, he or she confesses sins to a priest, and along with a blessing, receives an order to do something, such as say certain prayers. This assignment is also called penance."
Perilous,"Something that is dangerous or very risky can be described with the adjective <i>perilous</i>. If you are driving in a blizzard, you may kick yourself for making such a <i>perilous</i> journey.<br><br>The adjective <i>perilous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>periculum</i>, meaning dangerous. Words from the same root include <i>peril</i>, a noun meaning a dangerous situation, and <i>imperil</i>, a verb meaning to put in danger. The last thing you want to do as a parent is to imperil your children. Unfortunately, childhood is filled with peril — from climbing on the monkey bars to eating paste, dirt, or bugs. If you think you can prevent all perilous situations, you haven't been a parent very long!"
Peripatetic,"If you're reading this on a treadmill or while taking a walk, you may know about the <i>peripatetic,</i> or walking, philosopher Aristotle, who taught while strolling with his students. Or, maybe you just like being a <i>peripatetic,</i> a walking wanderer.<br><br><i>Peri-</i> is the Greek word for ""around,"" and <i>peripatetic</i> is an adjective that describes someone who likes to walk or travel around. <i>Peripatetic</i> is also a noun for a person who travels from one place to another or moves around a lot. If you walk in a circle, you are peripatetic, or walking, but you aren’t a peripatetic, or wanderer, unless you actually go somewhere."
Perpetual,"Use the adjective <i>perpetual</i> to describe something that never ends or changes. If you're a <i>perpetual</i> procrastinator, your dilly-dallying ways are never going to improve.<br><br>It may be true that the only constant is change, but English nevertheless has no shortage of words to describe things that never change: <i>everlasting, eternal</i>, and <i>permanent</i>, for example — and this word, <i>perpetual</i>, from the Latin <i>perpetuus</i>, ""continuous."" In casual usage, though, you might hear someone say ""This <i>perpetual</i> bad weather needs to clear."" Maybe it should come as no surprise to find people using the word to describe things that are not truly everlasting — since so few things really are."
Personable,"If you're <i>personable</i>, you're friendly and get along well with other people. Being <i>personable</i> is part of what makes you the star of the sales team — people just seem to like you.<br><br>Someone who's personable can be outgoing, charming, nice, bubbly, amiable, pleasing, or generous, but he doesn’t have to be all of those things — it just all needs to add up to being pleasant. You may be pleasant but not bubbly, and that’s personable. In fact, if you're too bubbly, you might stop being personable and become annoying, which is not personable."
Pertinent,"Something <i>pertinent</i> is relevant and on-point. If you give your best friend <i>pertinent</i> advice, that means the advice is appropriate for the situation.<br><br>Something pertinent is related to the current topic or situation — and probably helpful too. If you're in math class and you make a comment about World War I, that's likely not pertinent. If you're in music class and you talk about a cello, that probably is pertinent. Pertinent things are appropriate and logical. In most situations, people like to get comments and questions that are pertinent — anything else can just seem like a distraction."
Peruse,"Traditionally, <i>peruse</i> has meant to read or examine something carefully. But informally, it can have the opposite meaning, to read something casually and quickly.<br><br>To understand the two meanings, think about the way people like to talk about doing things thoroughly, even when they aren't. If you are visiting a library or a bookstore, you might find yourself <i>perusing</i> the shelves. Synonyms are <i>browse</i> and <i>skim</i>. <i>Peruse</i> is from Middle English <i>perusen</i> ""to use up,"" from the Latin prefix <i>per-</i> ""thoroughly"" plus Middle English <i>usen</i> ""to use."""
Pervade,"To <i>pervade</i> means to be present throughout, to exist in every part of. If you have too many cats, the horrible smell of cat pee will <i>pervade</i> your house.<br><br>You can use <i>pervade</i> both for external things like smells and sickness, and for more internal things like feelings. For instance, you can say that a feeling of doom pervaded the army as they caught sight of the opposition’s superior forces. Despite efforts to prevent bullying, peer pressure and clique mentalities pervade the school environment."
Petty,"<i>Petty</i> used to mean just ""petite"" or ""small,"" but now it's used for things that are trivial and shouldn’t matter much. If you host world leaders and spend more time picking napkins than memorizing names, you're focused on <i>petty</i> things.<br><br>A few neutral meanings of <i>petty</i> are still in use today — such as ""petty cash,"" which refers to a small amount of cash on hand — but most uses of <i>petty</i> since the 16th century are negative, as in ""narrow-minded,"" ""trivial,"" and ""of little importance."" A ""<i>petty</i> argument"" is a popular expression, because many people get all worked up over something that isn't very important — a petty concern — that seems much smaller after the heat of the moment."
Petulant,"Choose the adjective <i>petulant</i> to describe a person or behavior that is irritable in a childish way.<br><br>The adjective, <i>petulant,</i> is a disapproving term used to describe a bad-tempered child, an adult behaving like an angry child or behavior or this type. <i>Angry</i> or <i>annoyed</i> mean the same thing, but if you choose the word, <i>petulant,</i> you are indicating that it is unreasonable or unjustified. <i>Petulant</i> came to English in the late 16th century from the Latin <i>petulantem</i> ""forward, insolent"" but was not recorded to mean childishly irritable until the late 1700s."
Phalanx,"A <i>phalanx</i> is a tightly knit group of people or things, like an army troop or a bunch of fans of the same band.<br><br><i>Phalanx</i> refers to any tightly formed group of soldiers or officers, and historically defines a body of Macedonian infantry whose shields overlapped. From that sense, it came to mean any close-knit group. Another definition of <i>phalanx</i> — any bone in a finger or toe — also came out of the military sense: these bones work together closely, just like a military phalanx. The plural for these bones is <i>phalanges</i>, while  the plural for the other senses is <i>phalanxes</i>."
Pitiable,"<i>Pitiable</i> describes something that's pathetic or miserable. After learning about the <i>pitiable</i> conditions of schools in parts of rural India, you might decide to donate supplies to them.<br><br>Just looking at <i>pitiable</i> gives you clues to its meaning. <i>Pity</i> is a feeling of sorrow for someone or something else, so something that's pitiable is worthy of pity. There's often a little bit of scorn thrown in, like the pitiable amount of cereal your stingy grandmother pours in your bowl at breakfast. In this case, there's some blame cast on the grandmother because she chooses to give so little cereal."
Pleonasm,"<i>Pleonasm</i> is using more words than you need to, either accidentally or deliberately. An example of <i>pleonasm</i>? ""She picked up the tiny little baby kitten.""<br><br>The Greek root word in <i>pleonasm</i> is <i>pleonazein</i>, which describes something as more than enough. Used accidentally, a pleonasm is just long-winded wordiness, like a sentence that includes far more words than is necessary. Used on purpose, pleonasm is a tool used by writers and speakers to emphasize something or clarify an idea through repetition. This helps audiences remember main ideas as they listen or read."
Pliant,"The adjective <i>pliant</i> describes something that is capable of being bent. ""The teenager showed off her <i>pliant</i> spine every time she draped herself over a piece of furniture. Why hanging upside down off the sofa didn't give her a headache, her mother would never know.""<br><br><i>Pliant</i> has both a literal and a figurative meaning. <i>Pliant</i> can describe something that is bendable — like a spine, a tree branch, a bendy straw — or it can describe something that is flexible, but less tangible. In this latter sense, <i>pliant</i> describes something that adjusts to conditions or is easily influenced: ""In order to survive the recession, the company had to be <i>pliant</i> and adjust to the new economic conditions."""
Ploy,"A <i>ploy</i> is a clever plan that helps you get what you want. A manipulative little girl might shed tears simply as a <i>ploy</i> to get her mother to buy her ice cream.<br><br>A politician might add amendments to a bill as a ploy to delay voting, or a hooligan might yell, ""Fire!"" in a movie theater as a ploy to sneak his friends in. A sneaky move in a game is a ploy, and sensational news about a celebrity can be just a ploy to get him more media attention. The first recorded use of <i>ploy</i> was in 1722, meaning ""anything with which one amuses oneself"" in Scottish and Northern English dialects."
Ply,"<i>Ply</i> means to work steadily at something. If you've got a lemonade stand and you're busy perfecting your recipe and seeking out customers, you're doing a good job of <i>plying</i> your trade.<br><br>A ship that regularly travels a particular route plies that route. When someone offers you food or drink, often in hopes of getting something in return, they're plying you: ""If I ply you with cake, will you take my dog for a walk?"" The noun <i>ply</i> is very different from the verb, referring to layers or strands. Four-ply yarn is made up of four strands. Plywood is made of many layers of wood glued together."
Pommel,"A <i>pommel</i> is the rounded knob on a horse's saddle that a rider grips with one hand. The raised front of the saddle itself can also be called a <i>pommel</i>.<br><br>Some saddles, particularly the modern western type, have a metal grip at the front, known either as a horn or a <i>pommel</i>. Other saddles don't have this knob, but instead have a raised front edge that's also called the <i>pommel</i>. When <i>pommel</i> is used as a verb, it means ""beat or strike repeatedly,"" a variation on the word <i>pummel</i>. The Old French root is <i>pomel</i>, ""rounded knob,"" from the Latin word <i>pomum</i>, or ""apple."""
Pompous,"A <i>pompous</i> person is arrogant or conceited. He'll walk into a party with an inflated ego, ready to tell anyone who will listen that ""I'm kind of a big deal.""<br><br>Today we associate the adjective <i>pompous</i> with self-important jerks. But it's actually derived from the Old French <i>pompeux</i>, which meant “stately."" And that's why you can also use <i>pompous</i> to describe something with a lot of ceremonial or stately display — in other words, something surrounded by ""<i>pomp</i> and circumstance."""
Poop 1.,"<i>Poop</i> is a somewhat childish word for feces. When used as a verb, it means going number two.<br><br><i>Poop</i> is a very commonly used slang word that means <i>feces</i> and is far more acceptable than <i>crap</i> and <i>shit</i>. The only downside is that talking about pooping or poop sounds kind of silly. Still, no one will blink if you say ""I need to take a poop"" or ""Go clean up your dog's poop!"" There are a few other unrelated meanings — like the rear ""poop deck"" of a ship and ""the poop"", meaning the inside information on something."
Poop 2.,"<i>Poop</i> is a somewhat childish word for feces. When used as a verb, it means going number two.<br><br><i>Poop</i> is a very commonly used slang word that means <i>feces</i> and is far more acceptable than <i>crap</i> and <i>shit</i>. The only downside is that talking about pooping or poop sounds kind of silly. Still, no one will blink if you say ""I need to take a poop"" or ""Go clean up your dog's poop!"" There are a few other unrelated meanings — like the rear ""poop deck"" of a ship and ""the poop"", meaning the inside information on something."
Porcelain,"Your mom's favorite white china plates are probably made out of <i>porcelain</i>. <i>Porcelain</i> is a nearly translucent ceramic material used to make plates, bowls, and cups.<br><br>The dishes at a fancy restaurant are often porcelain, a fine, delicate kind of china. Sometimes knickknacks, dolls, and art objects are also made from porcelain. The word comes from the Italian word for ""cowrie shell,"" <i>porcellana</i>, which compares the shiny look of porcelain to the polished inside of a shell. <i>Porcelain</i> has a tricky spelling — although it ends with <i>ain</i>, it rhymes with ten, not rain."
Potpourri,"The noun <i>potpourri</i> can refer to a mixture or collection of seemingly unrelated items, an unusual assortment. You may own a <i>potpourri</i> of books — from classic literature to trashy novels and from Shakespeare's plays to comic books.<br><br>The noun <i>potpourri</i> often refers to a scented mixture of spices and dried flowers that is usually kept in a decorative bowl or jar and used to perfume a room. What's interesting is that the name for this attractively fragrant mixture comes from the French phrase <i>pot pourri</i>, which literally means ""rotten pot."" The phrase was used to describe a stew. Clearly, some things translate better than others."
Pragmatic,"To describe a person or a solution that takes a realistic approach, consider the adjective <i>pragmatic</i>. The four-year-old who wants a unicorn for her birthday isn't being very pragmatic.<br><br>The opposite of <i>idealistic</i> is <i>pragmatic</i>, a word that describes a philosophy of ""doing what works best."" From Greek <i>pragma</i> ""deed,"" the word has historically described philosophers and politicians who were concerned more with real-world application of ideas than with abstract notions. A pragmatic person is sensible, grounded, and practical — and doesn't expect a birthday celebration filled with magical creatures."
Pratfall,"A <i>pratfall</i> is a mistake that is particularly embarrassing, like going to a job interview with stains on your shirt. It can also be a silly goof done on purpose to make people laugh, like slipping on a banana peel.<br><br>A pratfall originally referred to a fall on your butt, which was often done by comic actors for laughs. From there, it came to mean all sorts of unplanned screw-ups. A restaurant caught serving horsemeat has committed a pratfall. A politician’s inappropriate joke is a verbal pratfall. A football player who runs the wrong way and scores for the other team has done a pratfall. Oops!"
Preamble,"A <i>preamble</i> is a brief introduction to a speech, like the <i>Preamble</i> to the Constitution that starts out ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union...do ordain and establish this Constitution.""<br><br><i>Preamble</i> comes from the Latin <i>praeambulus</i> which means ""walking before."" And that's what a <i>preamble</i> does — it ""walks"" before a speech, often explaining what's coming. It's like the White Rabbit introducing the Queen of Hearts in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  Since it goes before a speech, think of it as a <i>pre-ramble</i>.  A <i>preamble</i> is usually used for formal documents; you wouldn't include one in a text to your best friend."
Preclude,"To <i>preclude</i> something is to prevent it from happening. A muzzle <i>precludes</i> a dog from biting.<br><br>This is a very formal word, but it has a simple meaning: when something is precluded, it can't happen. See the prefix <i>pre</i> in <i>preclude</i> and in <i>prevent</i>? It is signaling that these words are all about things done before another action would happen — to make it impossible. Staying away from water precludes the possibility of drowning, though it also precludes any chance of having fun swimming."
Preen,"When a bird or a cat <i>preens</i>, it smooths its feathers or cleans its fur. When you <i>preen</i>, you primp and pay careful attention to how you're dressed and groomed, as if you're inviting the whole world to watch you.<br><br>You can also <i>preen</i> just by puffing yourself up and congratulating yourself for something. You've just landed your triple flip on the ski jump, and, as you swoosh to a stop at the foot of the hill and take off your skis, you <i>preen</i> as you make your way through the adoring crowd."
Prelude 1.,"The prefix ""pre-"" means “before,” so it makes sense that a <i>prelude</i> is an introductory action, event or performance that comes before a bigger or more momentous one.<br><br>People speaking old school French and Latin understood a prelude to be the ""notes sung or played to test the voice or instrument.""  Today preludes are more like introductions than practice, but you can still think of them as a small warm up to the main event. Preludes are often used in classical music, as well as in novels, to set the tone for the rest of the orchestral piece or story."
Prelude 2.,"The prefix ""pre-"" means “before,” so it makes sense that a <i>prelude</i> is an introductory action, event or performance that comes before a bigger or more momentous one.<br><br>People speaking old school French and Latin understood a prelude to be the ""notes sung or played to test the voice or instrument.""  Today preludes are more like introductions than practice, but you can still think of them as a small warm up to the main event. Preludes are often used in classical music, as well as in novels, to set the tone for the rest of the orchestral piece or story."
Premonition,"Some people claim to have <i>premonitions</i>, such as a dream about a friend they haven't seen in years the night before the friend dies. A <i>premonition</i> is a warning that comes in advance, or a feeling that something is going to happen.<br><br>Like the synonym <i>foreboding</i>, a <i>premonition</i> usually refers to something bad or harmful. This noun is from Middle French <i>premonicion</i>, from Late Latin <i>praemonitio,</i> from Latin <i>praemonere</i> ""to warn in advance,"" from the prefix <i>prae-</i> ""before"" plus <i>monere</i> ""to warn."""
Preposterous,"To a vegetarian, the idea of eating a 52-ounce T-bone steak would seem <i>preposterous</i> — absolutely absurd.<br><br>When the word <i>preposterous</i> was first used, it meant reversing the normal order of things — putting what was last first, and vice versa. Imagine putting on your underwear over your pants and you'll see that there's a kind of absurdity in something that's backwards, which is why <i>preposterous</i> came to mean ""ridiculous."" The word is often used as part of an exclamation: a chef who is asked to cook with nothing but jelly beans might exclaim, ""That's <i>preposterous</i>!"""
Prescient,"To be <i>prescient</i> is to have foresight or foreknowledge. We can use this word to describe people themselves, or what they say or do at a given moment.<br><br>You probably know that the Latin prefix <i>pre-</i> means ""before,"" so you might be able to figure out that the word <i>prescient,</i> from the verb <i>praescire,</i> means to ""know beforehand."" People like economists, sports commentators, and political analysts often get tagged with this word, because it's part of their job to sift through the data and make predictions — and sometimes they get it right. And when they're not just lucky, we might say they're prescient."
Pretentious,"Use the adjective <i>pretentious</i> as a way to criticize people who try to act like they are more important or knowledgeable than they really are.<br><br>You might not be surprised to learn that <i>pretentious</i> is related to the word <i>pretend</i>, and it is an adjective that fits the bill for describing someone who's only concerned with making an impressive appearance. If you don't want to be accused of being pretentious, just act naturally and don't put on airs!"
Prickly,"<i>Prickly</i> things are sharp and spiky, while <i>prickly</i> people are quick to be offended or irritated. Ouch!<br><br>A prickly tag in the collar of your new shirt can make you uncomfortable all day, and so can a prickly co-worker whose feelings seem to get hurt by everything you say. Porcupines and cactuses are prickly, and so is the next-door neighbor who is constantly irritated with you. The first thing that was described as <i>prickly</i>, in the 1570s, was a holly leaf."
Privy,"If you're <i>privy</i> to something, you've been let in on a secret or know about something that most people don't. Not many people are <i>privy</i> to what those top secret documents are all about, for example.<br><br>The adjective <i>privy</i> comes from the Latin <i>privatus</i>, meaning “private,” and describes someone who has knowledge of secret or confidential information. But watch out: If you use <i>privy</i> as a noun, it can mean “outhouse” or “toilet,” which actually might be a good place to hide your diary if you don't want anyone else to be privy to its contents."
Proclivity,"A <i>proclivity</i> is a natural tendency to like something, such as your sister's <i>proclivity</i> for restaurants that serve hot, spicy food.<br><br>When you have a proclivity, it feels automatic — you like what you like; you don't even have to think about it. The origin of the word <i>proclivity</i> supports this feeling. <i>Proclivity</i> comes from the Latin word <i>proclivis</i>, which literally means ""sloping forward."" You slide toward a proclivity — no effort is needed. You just give in to it, since you're headed in that direction naturally."
Progeny,"<i>Progeny</i> means ""offspring"" or ""children."" You and your brothers are the <i>progeny</i> of your parents, and your cat's new litter of kittens is her <i>progeny</i>.<br><br>Synonyms for <i>progeny</i> include <i>descendants</i>, <i>product</i>, and <i>offspring</i>, so you're also your grandparents' and great-grandparents' progeny. And, if your pet goat has babies every spring, you'll get to raise dozens of her progeny. Plants have progeny too — blow the fluffy seeds of a dandelion in your yard and its progeny can multiply, summer after summer, until your lawn is full of cheerful yellow flowers."
Proliferation,"<i>Proliferation</i> is a rapid multiplication of parts or the increase in the number of something. Nuclear <i>proliferation</i> is a rapid increase of nuclear weapons.<br><br>The proliferation of any living thing will often create an overpopulation problem and cause an environmental imbalance. A proliferation of fuzzy koala bears might seem kind of nice, but these cute little creatures would soon eat up all the eucalyptus, running out of food and causing problems for other species. We almost always use this word to describe stuff we don't want to increase rapidly. The excessive proliferation of mutated cells, for instance, is how cancer grows."
Prolific,"Someone or something that is <i>prolific</i> is fruitful or highly productive. A <i>prolific</i> songwriter can churn out five hit tunes before breakfast.<br><br>It is interesting to note that many of the words used to describe the adjective <i>prolific</i> are relayed in biological terms, such as ""to give birth,"" ""nourish,"" and ""fertile."" Other uses of the word pertain to having many ideas or an active and expressive mind, such as a ""<i>prolific</i> writer."" Clearly, people like to consider that the ideas or things that they make are in some way produced by them like flowers or fruit!"
Prolix,"A book that feels like it is several hundred pages longer than it needs to be is <i>prolix</i>. The word simply means that something has too many words and goes on too long.<br><br>To avoid being called prolix, we'll keep this short. <i>Prolix</i> means using more words than necessary. For a less formal word choice try wordy, verbose, long-winded or drawn out."
Promontory,"A <i>promontory</i> is a high, rocky cliff jutting into a body of water. A <i>promontory</i> is just the kind of thing a heroine will threaten to throw herself off of if the love of her life does not return to her.<br><br>A promontory can be a foreland, headland, or rocky cliff. Think Ireland’s Cliffs of Moher jutting into the sea. Connect <i>promontory</i> with <i>prominent,</i> ""important or sticking out,"" <i>project</i>, ""estimate forward"" and <i>protrude,</i> ""stick out,"" which also carry this sense of jutting out. In anatomy, <i>promontory</i> can refer to a projecting part of the body."
Promulgate,"To <i>promulgate</i> is to officially put a law into effect. Your state may announce a plan to <i>promulgate</i> a new traffic law on January 1st.<br><br>Laws aren't the only things you can promulgate. The word <i>promulgate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>promulgatus</i>, meaning ""make publicly known."" Someone can promulgate values, belief systems, and philosophies — it just means they're promoted or made public. For example, you might write an article to promulgate the benefits of eating only organic foods."
Prone,"If you're <i>prone</i> to doing something, it means you're likely to do it, have a habit of doing it, or are susceptible to it. People who are <i>prone</i> to getting the flu every winter should probably get a flu shot in the fall.<br><br>The second meaning of <i>prone</i> is ""lying face down,"" and the Latin root is <i>pronare</i>, ""to bend forward."" This is a handy way to remember both meanings: if you tend to wait to start your term paper until the night before it's due, you are prone to procrastination — you bend toward it.  If you stay up so late you fall asleep face down in the book, you are now prone at your desk."
Propensity,"A <i>propensity</i> is a natural tendency to behave in a certain way. We all have <i>propensities</i> — things we tend to do. Dogs have a <i>propensity</i> to bark, and many people have a <i>propensity</i> for getting annoyed by it.<br><br>If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder."
Prowess,"<i>Prowess</i> means exceptional skill or ability. Your sailing <i>prowess</i> might save your life in a storm, while someone with less experience might make mistakes.<br><br>An earlier meaning of this word is exceptional bravery in battle, or a specific act of bravery. <i>Prowess</i> is from Middle English, from Old French <i>proece, proesse,</i> from <i>prou, prud</i> ""good, capable, brave."" The related English word <i>proud</i> has the now obsolete meaning of brave."
Proximity,"The word <i>proximity</i> means nearness or closeness. ""Because of the proximity of our desks, I couldn't help but notice him cheating on the exam.""<br><br>Your favorite thing about your neighborhood of attached row houses might be the proximity of your neighbors — they're really close to you. <i>Proximity</i> comes from the Latin <i>proximus</i>, ""nearest,"" which also gives us <i>approximate</i>, ""close to the actual."" You can use this noun to talk about a physical closeness, or something that's near in time, like the proximity of the months April and May."
Prudent,"Describe an action as <i>prudent</i> if it is the wise thing to do under the existing circumstances. If you're getting in trouble, it is probably <i>prudent</i> to keep your mouth closed and just listen.<br><br>If you show good and careful judgment when handling practical matters, you can be described as prudent. Similarly, a wise and well-thought-through decision or action can be called prudent. The word comes from a contracted form of the Latin <i>prōvidēns</i> from the verb ""to foresee."" The English word <i>provident</i> ""wise in planning for the future"" is the non-contracted descendent of the same Latin root."
Punctilious,"A <i>punctilious</i> person pays attention to details. Are you always precisely on time? Is your room perfectly neat? Do you never forget a birthday or a library book's due date? Then you are one of the <i>punctilious</i> people.<br><br>The adjective <i>punctilious</i>, pronounced ""punk-TIL-ee-us,"" is related to the Italian word <i>puntiglio</i>, meaning ""fine point."" For someone who is <i>punctilious</i> no point is too fine, no detail too small, to be overlooked. The word is often used to describe people, but it can be used more broadly to apply to observations, behavior, or anything else that is characterized by close attention to detail."
Punitive,"<i>Punitive</i> describes inflicting a punishment. If someone takes <i>punitive</i> action against you, you'll probably whine and complain — you're in trouble and you're about to get punished.<br><br>An easy way to remember the meaning of <i>punitive</i> is that it looks like the word <i>punish</i> — both come from the Latin root word <i>punire</i>, ""to inflict a penalty on."" <i>Punitive</i> doesn't always refer to a person-to-person punishment, like a mom disciplining a child. It can also describe the unpleasant result of an action on a large scale, like the punitive effect higher taxes will have on the middle class."
Purport,"Use <i>purport</i> when you want to convince people about something that might not be true, like when you <i>purport</i> that the dog ate your homework.<br><br>The verb <i>purport</i> can mean ""to claim"" — whether you mean it or not — or ""to intend,"" like when you purport to study all night. So it makes sense that as a noun, <i>purport</i> means the intention or purpose, like the purport of a political candidate's speech was to get your vote. If the speech was long and hard to follow, you might be lucky just to get the purport, which here means ""the main point or meaning."""
Putty,"<i>Putty</i> is the clay-like substance you can use to fill holes in a wall before painting it, or to secure a piece of glass in a window frame.<br><br>Putty comes in different colors and consistencies, but it's generally a very soft doughy material that can fit it small or awkward spaces and hardens after a certain amount of time. Before painting a wall, you might want to putty any holes or cracks, using a putty knife. After the putty dries, you can sand it smooth. The word comes from the French <i>potée</i>, ""polishing powder."""
Pyre,"<i>Pyre</i> rhymes with <i>fire</i>. It's also a noun for a large pile of stuff for burning. Most times a <i>pyre</i> is part of a funeral — the body is burned on it.<br><br>From the Greek <i>pura</i> or <i>pur</i>, meaning ""fire,"" <i>pyre</i> came into English in the 17th century. <i>Pyr</i> is also the Czech word for ""hot ashes."" Remember, a pyre isn't the fire itself but the stuff that helps the fire burn, as firewood at a campfire. People and animals are burned on a pyre as part of a traditional funeral ceremony in some countries."
Pyrrhic,"Use the adjective <i>pyrrhic</i> to describe a victory that is won, but at too great a cost. In this use as an adjective, the word is often capitalized.<br><br>The word <i>pyrrhic</i> comes from the Greek general, Pyrrhus, who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Asculum but lost so many troops that he couldn't defeat Rome itself. If you are the winner in an argument with your brother, but the fight ends up ruining your relationship with him, it's a Pyrrhic victory. An ancient Greek war dance is also called a <i>pyrrhic</i>."
Quagmire,"A <i>quagmire</i> is a dangerous place, like the muddy shoreline of a pond. Because it's so hard to climb out of a <i>quagmire</i>, the word has also come to also mean any difficult or sticky situation you find yourself in.<br><br>Long ago, <i>quag</i> was a synonym for ""bog"" or ""marsh,"" a swampy area where water seems to sit instead of drain out. <i>Mire</i> is another word to describe such a place. As a verb <i>mire</i> means ""stuck,"" like someone who's mired in quicksand or mired in work — both prevent you from going anywhere. In a quagmire, you get stuck physically — or, even more commonly, in a situation that is hard to escape because there is no easy solution."
Quaint,"<i>Quaint</i> means strange and unusual in an old-fashioned and charming way. It's a word you'd use to describe a little store that sells tea cozies and antique tea services, or your grandmother's habit of calling the radio the ""wireless.""<br><br>There is a commonly used sarcastic sense of quaint––when something is run down or shabby and you're trying to say something positive, you might substitute ""How...quaint"" for ""How...interesting."" In Middle English, this adjective meant clever or cunning. Its origin is Old French <i>queinte, cointe</i>, from Latin <i>cognitus</i> ""known,"" from <i>cognōscere</i> ""to learn."""
Quell,"Meaning to suppress or overcome, <i>quell</i> is what you have to do with nerves before a big test and fears before going skydiving.<br><br>When it first came into existence, the verb <i>quell</i> actually meant “to murder.” That's a bit more serious than our modern definition, but you can use that old definition to help you imagine offing your worries or putting a permanent end to criticism. These days <i>quell</i> is often used to mean ""pacify,"" as in the police quelling an angry mob or a mom quelling a kid's temper tantrum."
Raffle 1.,"A <i>raffle</i> is a type of contest in which you buy a ticket for a chance to win a prize. After the tickets are sold, a drawing determines which ticket holds the winning number. People <i>raffle</i> off everything from fruit baskets to cars.<br><br>You might enter a raffle at a school gathering, a fair, or another event. The proceeds from selling raffle tickets often go toward a good cause, like a charity. When a group holds a raffle, you can also say that they <i>raffle</i> the prizes off — your French club might raffle off a bicycle to raise money for your trip to Montreal, for example. A <i>raffle</i> was originally ""a dice game."""
Raffle 2.,"A <i>raffle</i> is a type of contest in which you buy a ticket for a chance to win a prize. After the tickets are sold, a drawing determines which ticket holds the winning number. People <i>raffle</i> off everything from fruit baskets to cars.<br><br>You might enter a raffle at a school gathering, a fair, or another event. The proceeds from selling raffle tickets often go toward a good cause, like a charity. When a group holds a raffle, you can also say that they <i>raffle</i> the prizes off — your French club might raffle off a bicycle to raise money for your trip to Montreal, for example. A <i>raffle</i> was originally ""a dice game."""
Rake,"If it’s fall and the yard is covered with leaves, you'll want to get out the <i>rake</i>, a long-handled tool with a row of tines. Either that, or get out the excuses and leave the leaves where they lie.<br><br><i>Rake</i> has several senses, including to use a rake to gather leaves or smooth soil. <i>Rake</i> can also mean to search something — the way police may rake through a crime scene for clues or the way you may rake through a messy desk to find a pencil. A rake is also a slanted plane — it's often used to refer to a slanted stage in a theater. In high society, a rake is an immoral man."
Rambunctious,"<i>Rambunctious</i> means ""noisy and out of control,"" like a <i>rambunctious</i> child who is so hard to handle that no babysitter has ever come back a second time.<br><br>People who are <i>rambunctious</i>, pronounced ""ram-BUNK-shus,"" can be fun — to a point. Laughing a little too loudly, or too often, seems refreshing at first — so what if people sitting at other tables have started to look over? But after a while, rambunctious behavior makes you feel tired. You never know when the high energy of the rambunctious is going to cross over to obnoxiousness, when things will spill, feelings get hurt, and apologizes need to be made."
Rampant,"<i>Rampant</i> means wild, out of control, to be up on your hind legs roaring at the world. You don't have to be four-legged: ""The children ran <i>rampant</i> at the supermarket even though their mother tried to control them.""<br><br>If you're running <i>rampant</i>, you're on a <i>rampage</i>. Both come from the French word <i>ramper</i> meaning ""to climb, creep"" like an animal on hind legs, paws in climbing-mode, or like wild plants such as the kudzu that ran <i>rampant</i> over an old barn until the entire thing was covered. There can also be <i>rampant</i> wildfires that destroy houses in the Southwest, or robots that run <i>rampant</i> in the lab after the janitor accidentally sets them free."
Rancid,"<i>Rancid</i> means sour, rotten, and nasty and refers most specifically to the sharp bad smell of decomposing oils or fats. <i>""Rancid""</i> is a great name for a post-punk band, but a lousy way to describe the sauce on your eggs Benedict.<br><br>If you've never had the pleasure of smelling something rancid, life has quite a wallop in store for you. As meat, fat, or oil decomposes the chemical change creates a sharp wretched stink that will cause you to recoil. It's just foul. The powerful horrendous fragrance of rancid butter, therefore, makes the word wonderfully potent to describe all sorts of things — from a corrupt dictatorship to a party that's gone on a few hours too long."
Rapt,"To be <i>rapt</i> is to be carried away, caught up, or otherwise engrossed in something. If a performer is really good or particularly mesmerizing, the audience will be totally <i>rapt</i>.<br><br><i>Rapt</i> developed from the Latin <i>raptus</i>, meaning to “seize, carry off."" So imagine something so interesting that it seizes your attention and carries you off to another world. In fact, <i>rapt</i> is related to the word <i>rapture</i>, which is an experience of extreme, other-worldly happiness. So do your teacher a favor and give her your <i>rapt</i> attention during math class."
Rapture,"<i>Rapture</i> is a feeling of emotional ecstasy so magical it's almost as if you've been transported to some other world.<br><br>Coming to us from an old French word meaning ""carried away,"" rapture certainly involves getting swept off to Shangri-La. It's happiness so extreme that you just about float to heaven, complete with big goofy grin plastered to your face. Traditionally reserved for those feeling spiritual ecstasy, <i>rapture</i> now extends to anyone feeling overwhelmed by emotion — sparked by everything from a passionate kiss to scoring an awesome dress on sale."
Rapturous,"If you're blissfully happy, you're <i>rapturous</i>. You could describe your purring cat rolling around in catnip as <i>rapturous</i>.<br><br>The adjective <i>rapturous</i> is great for describing someone who's delighted, like the rapturous excitement of a room full of teenagers at their favorite pop star's concert, or the rapturous look on a child's face when she opens her birthday present and finds exactly what she had hoped for. The root word of <i>rapturous</i> is the Latin <i>raptus</i> or ""a carrying off,"" and until the mid-1600s, that's exactly what <i>rapture</i> was used to mean."
Raucous,"<i>Raucous</i> means unpleasantly loud, or behaving in a noisy and disorderly way. It can be hard to give an oral report in the front of a classroom when the kids in the back are being <i>raucous</i>.<br><br><i>Raucous</i> is often used to refer to loud laughter, loud voices, or a loud party, all of which can be harsh or unpleasant. Near synonyms are <i>strident</i> and <i>rowdy</i>. This adjective is from Latin <i>raucus</i> ""hoarse."" Think of raucous as people whose hoarseness can't come on too soon."
Raunchy,"Something <i>raunchy</i> is dirty in one sense or another: it's either literally covered in dirt or suggesting dirty sexual situations.<br><br><i>Raunchy</i> started off as Army Air Corps slang for something sloppy in 1939. But by the 60's the word had grown to imply another kind of dirtiness: the vulgar, sexual kind. So these days it's safe to assume that a raunchy movie, for example, is full of foul language, obscenities, and graphic sex scenes. And in case you're wondering, an R-rated movie is much more likely to be raunchy than a G movie."
Rave 1.,"If you <i>rave</i> about a book you just read, you're telling people you think it's great, or you're giving it a <i>rave</i> review.<br><br><i>Rave</i> has two levels, one that implies you're very excited about something and the other that you are too excited, so you seem crazy. While raving about a movie means to talk it up, being a raving lunatic means you are engaging in a lot of crazy talk. When you rave about a performance, you talk enthusiastically about it. Take that enthusiastic talking to the next level, and you might be called raving in the crazy sense."
Rave 2.,"If you <i>rave</i> about a book you just read, you're telling people you think it's great, or you're giving it a <i>rave</i> review.<br><br><i>Rave</i> has two levels, one that implies you're very excited about something and the other that you are too excited, so you seem crazy. While raving about a movie means to talk it up, being a raving lunatic means you are engaging in a lot of crazy talk. When you rave about a performance, you talk enthusiastically about it. Take that enthusiastic talking to the next level, and you might be called raving in the crazy sense."
Ream,"A <i>ream</i> is a quantity of paper sold in a bundle, once comprised of 480 sheets but now rounded up to 500.  If you write <i>reams</i> of love letters to your beloved, I hope she appreciates them.  Or at least recycles.<br><br>The word <i>ream</i> has two distinct meanings, depending on whether you use it as a noun or a verb. As a noun, it refers to an amount of paper, its origin from the Arabic <i>rizmah</i>, or ""bundle."" As a verb, <i>ream</i> is a rough word that can mean ""to make a hole in"" or ""to squeeze.""  When you ""ream someone out"" you give them a scolding."
Recalcitrant,"If someone is so pig-headed that he won't budge on an issue, call him <i>recalcitrant</i>. Not that it will make a difference...<br><br><i>Recalcitrant</i> is from Latin <i>calcitrare</i>, meaning ""to kick,"" so someone who is recalcitrant is kicking back against what's wanted of them. Synonyms are <i>unruly, intractable,</i> and <i>refractory,</i> all referring to what is difficult to manage or control. Writers are frequently referring to recalcitrant Democrats and Republicans, since many people are stubbornly loyal to their political parties and unwilling to change."
Reclusive,"The adjective <i>reclusive</i> describes a desire for seclusion or privacy. A <i>reclusive</i> movie star is the one tabloid photographers dream of capturing on film.<br><br>The root word of <i>reclusive</i> is <i>recluse,</i> which came from the Old French word <i>reclus,</i> originally meaning ""a person shut up from the world for purposes of religious meditation."" Today, maybe you just want to be alone — <i>reclusive</i> describes a person who is withdrawn from society or seeks solitude, like a hermit. Grocery shopping late at night is a reclusive habit, because few people are in the store then."
Recourse,"<i>Recourse</i> is a source of help.   If you're failing trigonometry in spite of studying until your brain hurts, you may have no <i>recourse</i> but to hire a tutor.<br><br><i>Recourse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>recursus</i>, meaning “to run back or retreat.” People seek recourse from such difficulties as debt, illness and legal woes, so you can think of <i>recourse</i> as the words ""retreating from curses"" squished together.  For the record, though, the <i>cursus</i> in <i>recursus</i> means <i>course</i>, not <i>curse</i>. Actually, no one knows where the word <i>curse</i> comes from.  There may be some connection between <i>cursus</i> and <i>curses</i>, but then again, there may not be."
Recumbent,"Bikes on which you recline rather than sit upright are <i>recumbent</i>. <i>Recumbent</i> means leaning back in a reclining position.<br><br><i>Recumbent</i> starts like <i>recline</i>, which is an easy way to remember it. Your dad's position in his favorite La-Z-Boy reclining chair? Recumbent. Your position when you lay back on lounge chair at the pool? Also recumbent — and in both cases, these are both positions of comfort."
Redoubtable,"<i>Redoubtable</i> means honorable, maybe even intimidatingly so. If your grandmother worked tirelessly to raise four kids on her own and start her own taxi cab business and to this day, keeps all of her cabbies in line, she is without a doubt <i>redoubtable</i>.<br><br>The adjective <i>redoubtable</i> traces back to the French word <i>redute</i>, meaning “to dread,” a combination of the prefix <i>re-</i>, which adds emphasis, and <i>duter</i>, which mean “to doubt.” But it isn't the redoubtable person that you doubt — it's yourself or your ability to compete against or be compared to him or her. That's where the dread comes in. But you can learn a lot from and be inspired by redoubtable people, if you can just get over being afraid of them."
Remarkable,"Something <i>remarkable</i> is unusual, exceptional, interesting, or excellent. <i>Remarkable</i> things get your attention.<br><br>If you take this word literally, you can figure out the meaning: remarkable things make you want to make a remark about them. They get you talking because they're so unusual or good. Getting a B on a test isn't remarkable, unless you usually get D’s. Getting to meet the president would be pretty remarkable. Save this word for things that are really and truly exceptional."
Renown,"<i>Renown</i> is fame and acclaim — the kind of celebrity that most people only dream about. <i>Renown</i> is not only about celebrity, though; it also means being highly respected in one's field.<br><br>Actors, musicians, and artists practice their art, sometimes for many years, to gain the kind of <i>renown</i>, or fame, that will launch their faces onto the covers of magazines and make their name known in every household. Greta Garbo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Salvador Dali all became <i>renowned</i> in their respective fields. They won numerous awards, and who isn't familiar with their names? Even things or places can achieve <i>renown</i> if they offer something worth celebrating. An ice cream parlor can become renowned for its incredible mint chip ice cream, or a bank can be renowned for its excellent customer service."
Renowned,"Celebrated, gushed over, and even legendary, something that's <i>renowned</i> is really famous. If you not only find a cure for cancer, but you also go on lots of talk shows so everyone knows who you are, then you'll be a <i>renowned</i> scientist.<br><br><i>Renown</i> comes from the Anglo-Norman for ""re-name,"" as in repeatedly name, so something is renowned is something that people are talking about, or naming, over and over. If you are a huge celebrity, people from your home town might boast, ""The renowned Madame X was born here."" Something renowned is really good, not just famous. Just because you make the cover of a trashy tabloid magazine doesn't mean you're a renowned actress. But if you win an Oscar, you are."
Repatriate,"When a country <i>repatriates</i> people, they are usually refugees who are being sent back to their homeland, often against their wishes.<br><br>It is possible for a person to repatriate himself, choosing to return to a country he's left for political or economic reasons, but the verb <i>repatriate</i> is more often used to mean ""send refugees home."" It might sound like a modern political term, but <i>repatriate</i> has been used since the 1600s. It comes from the Latin word <i>repatriare</i>, ""return to one's own country,"" from the prefix <i>re</i>, ""back,"" and <i>patria</i>, ""native land."""
Replenish,"To <i>replenish</i> something is to refill it. If you have a pet pooch, you’re probably obligated to <i>replenish</i> his food bowl to avoid being barked at incessantly.<br><br>Use <i>replenish</i> when talking about something valuable or desirable, such as money or food. For example, you might discuss replenishing your bank account, but you wouldn’t speak of replenishing a trash can. You can also use <i>replenish</i> in a joking way to show that something is of value to you; by noting that the jar of jellybeans on your desk needs to be replenished, you indicate that you require jellybeans to survive your day at the office. We get that."
Replete,"<i>Replete</i> means full, often in a satisfying way. ""The library was <i>replete</i> with bound first editions, and Lucy, a bookworm, was happier there than any place else.""<br><br><i>Replete</i> shares a root with the word <i>plenty</i>. When you have plenty of cookies and cake, you can say your table is <i>replete</i> with goodies. Another cousin of <i>replete</i> is <i>replenish</i>. When your cabinets are bare, you go to the store to replenish them. When you unpack your groceries, your pantry is <i>replete</i> with essentials."
Repose,"<i>Repose</i> is a formal or literary term used to mean the act of resting, or the state of being at rest. <i>Repose</i> is also a state of mind: freedom from worry.<br><br>As a verb, <i>repose</i> means to rest or relax, or to rest on something for support: There she was, <i>reposing</i> on the front porch. The verb is from Middle English, from Old French <i>reposer</i>, from Late Latin <i>repausāre</i> ""to cause to rest,"" from the Latin prefix <i>re-</i> ""again"" plus <i>pausāre</i> ""to rest."""
Reprehensible,"<i>Reprehensible</i> means deserving of blame or strong criticism. It is a strong word––your mother might forgive you for doing something bad, but something <i>reprehensible</i>? That's worse.<br><br>Near synonyms are <i>blameworthy</i> and <i>culpable</i>. Antonyms are <i>blameless</i> and <i>praiseworthy</i>. The adjective <i>reprehensible</i> is from Middle English, from Latin <i>reprehensus,</i> from <i>reprehendere</i> plus the suffix <i>-ibilis</i> ""deserving of, capable of."" If someone is <i>reprehended</i>, they are blamed or strongly criticized."
Reprieve,"A <i>reprieve</i> is a break in or cancellation of a painful or otherwise lousy situation. If you're being tortured, a <i>reprieve</i> is a break from whatever's tormenting you.<br><br>For some, a night at the opera is a night of punishing boredom during which the only reprieve is the intermission. For others, it's baseball that feels like torture. The seventh-inning stretch is the only reprieve from a night of endless waiting. Often, you'll hear <i>reprieve</i> used when a court or governor decides not to execute a prisoner. That prisoner is given a reprieve and will be allowed to live. He probably won't get a reprieve from prison, though, unless he's found innocent."
Repugnant,"<i>Repugnant</i> refers to something you detest so thoroughly it threatens to make you physically sick, like the idea of marrying your sister. Or wearing last year's jeans.<br><br>A repugnant thing is a thing offensive, detestable, or obscene. It can be repugnant to your mind or your morals. It can also be physically repugnant, like the smell that comes from a restaurant’s dumpster, which hasn't been emptied since the very exciting ""Omelet Week,"" way back at the beginning of August. Makes you want to ""re-PLUG-nant"" your nose!"
Reputable,"Want the real scoop on your favorite singer's latest romance? Then you should probably find a more <i>reputable</i> source than the tabloids — meaning someone with a better reputation, in this case for telling the truth.<br><br>That's the thing with <i>reputable</i> reputations. People know you can be trusted, that you're honest and not trying to pull one over on anybody. <i>Reputable</i> institutions usually have a history of excellent service or outstanding work, and always come highly recommended. <i>Reputable</i> used car salesmen may seem scarce. The word <i>reputable</i> actually has a good deal of <i>reputability</i> itself, since it's been in standard use since the 17th century."
Rescind,"If get a call saying a company has decided to <i>rescind</i> your job offer, it's back to the classifieds for you. <i>Rescind</i> is an official reversal.<br><br>Things that are <i>rescinded:</i> policies, court decisions, regulations, and official statements. What all these examples have in common is that they are on the record. Also, <i>rescind</i> usually refers to promises instead of tangible objects. You can't <i>rescind</i> a shirt a friend has borrowed from you, but you can <i>rescind</i> your offer to loan them your jeans."
Resolute,"Use the adjective <i>resolute</i> to describe a purposeful and determined person, someone who wants to do something very much, and won't let anything get in the way.<br><br>""Milo thought for just a moment and then, with a <i>resolute</i> 'I shall,' volunteered to go,"" Norton Juster writes in the classic children's novel <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>. From the way Milo said ""I shall,"" we can infer that he was quite confident in his split-second decision, or at least made himself appear to be so. Some  near-synonyms for this word include <i>resolved, adamant, unswerving,</i> and <i>unwavering</i>. If you make a ""<i>resolute</i> refusal"" of something, you're declaring you don't like it and never will."
Respite,"A <i>respite</i> is a break from something that's difficult or unpleasant. If you're cramming for exams, take an occasional walk to give yourself a <i>respite</i> from the intensity.<br><br><i>Respite</i> may look like it rhymes with <i>despite</i>, but this word has a stress on its first syllable (RES-pit).  It comes from the Latin word <i>respectus</i>, meaning refuge, but we almost always use <i>respite</i> to describe a time, not a place, of relief. If you've been fighting with your partner, a visit from a friend might offer a brief respite from the argument, but the fight will pick up again when she leaves."
Resplendent,"Someone or something that is <i>resplendent</i> has great beauty and is a pleasure to behold.  ""She was there, at the base of the stairs, <i>resplendent</i> in her flowing gown and jewels.""<br><br>When people or things are <i>resplendent</i>, they are dazzling, splendiferous, glorious, or lovely.  The adjective <i>resplendent</i> comes from a Latin word that means “to shine brightly.”  The gilded entranceway was <i>resplendent</i> in the golden glow of the afternoon light.  When he flashed his <i>resplendent</i> smile, she was helpless against his charms."
Resuscitate,"To <i>resuscitate</i> is to revive a person who has lost consciousness. In recent years it's become important for people to learn CPR so that they might <i>resuscitate</i> someone who loses consciousness, and many schools and hospitals offer classes in CPR.<br><br>The Latin word <i>suscitāre</i>, ""to raise,"" combines with <i>re-</i>, ""again,"" to create the base of the verb <i>resuscitate</i>. Through the years, methods of resuscitation have advanced to the current sophisticated and effective levels of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, and defibrillation paddles that can shock a heart back to life. In fact, some patients nowadays ask to sign a ""do not <i>resuscitate</i>"" (DNR) order to allow them to die without medical interventions like resuscitation."
Retain,"<i>Retain</i> means to hold on to or keep. People who can <i>retain</i> a lot of information are often mistaken for geniuses, but really they just have very good memories.<br><br>To <i>retain</i> is to keep or maintain, whether in mind, possession or a certain condition. If you have a great personal assistant, you'll probably want to retain him for as long as you can. If your body is retaining water you might look a little plump. The verbs <i>restrain</i> and <i>detain</i> sound similar, but they mean to keep something by force."
Retentive,"If something is <i>retentive</i>, it is able to hold something else, so be glad if you have a <i>retentive</i> mind and grab a sponge if you need something <i>retentive</i> to sop up water.<br><br><i>Retentive</i> is closely related to the word, retain. Both words come from the Latin retinere which means to hold back. If you are a farmer, it's good to know how water-retentive your soil is, or how much water it can hold and store. How much information can your brain hold and store? For someone with a retentive mind or memory or eye, it's quite a lot!"
Retort,"A <i>retort</i> is a short, clever response to someone's comment or question. If you want to keep the peace during dinner, you should probably bite your tongue instead of making sarcastic <i>retorts</i> to everything your little sister says.<br><br>Today <i>retort</i> is used as both a noun and a verb, and both come from 16th- and 17th-century sources meaning ""to twist or turn back."" To retort is to make a comeback, or a quick, witty answer or remark. It can be a form of payback when someone tries to insult or tease another person, and often, the perfect retort doesn't occur to you till later, when you think ""Oh! I wish I had said that earlier!"""
Rev,"<i>Rev</i> your engine at a stoplight if you want to race the car next to you. On second thought, don’t — to <i>rev</i> is to crank the engine without going anywhere. Also, a <i>rev</i> is one complete rotation of a motor.<br><br><i>Rev</i>, as a verb or a noun, is a shortened form of <i>revolution</i>. As a noun, it’s a rotation of the motor or the number of rotations in a minute. The word has been around since the early 20th century, following the invention of the automobile. <i>Rev</i> can be used for any internal combustion engine, but it's most often used for the zooming sound of a car engine. <i>Rev</i> and <i>revolution</i> come from the Late Latin <i>revolutionem</i>, ""a revolving."""
Revel,"<i>Revel</i> means to take great pleasure. If you <i>revel</i> in something, you're not just pleased or even excited; you're overwhelmed by joy.<br><br>It used to mean riotous merry-making. Now it means to bask in the self-reflected glow of your own pleasure. You revel in your victory lap after winning the race. Your brother is constantly on your case for being clumsy, so when he knocks down a table filled with glassware, you revel in it. Think of it as a high level of pleasure."
Reverie,"If you're relaxing on the beach, dreaming of how you will never have to get up and go back to work, you're engaged in a <i>reverie</i>, or pleasant daydream.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with reverie, but if you follow its path into English, you'll see how closely it is connected to madness. The noun is from French <i>rêverie,</i> from a Middle French word meaning ""wild speech, delirium,"" from <i>rever</i> ""to roam, speak wildly."" Middle French <i>rever</i> is also the source of English <i>rave</i>, as in raving mad."
Rickety,"Something <i>rickety</i> — like an old shack — is shaky and likely to fall down because it's fragile.<br><br>Some buildings are sturdy, solid, and strong. Others are rickety: rickety things might blow over from a slight breeze. Rickety things are poorly designed or have just become rickety because of aging. Rickety things tend to shake, which is a sign they might fall apart any second. If you put a heavy load in a rickety cart, you might lost your load!"
Rife,"Use the adjective <i>rife</i> to mean ""full of"" or ""widespread,"" especially when you're talking about something negative. If the lifeguard says the water is <i>rife</i> with jellyfish, you're not going to want to swim in it.<br><br>Not to be confused with the word <i>ripe</i> (“fully developed”), <i>rife</i> means “abundant” or “prevalent.” <i>Rife</i> can follow the word it’s describing, as in “corruption was <i>rife</i> during his administration.” More commonly, however, <i>rife</i> comes before the word it modifies, accompanied by the preposition <i>with</i>, as in “the class was <i>rife</i> with yawns” or “her story was <i>rife</i> with inconsistencies.”"
Rigmarole,"<i>Rigmarole</i> is a good word for talking about situations that involve filling out confusing forms, standing in lines, or following complex rules.<br><br>Getting a driver's license, enrolling for college classes, and applying for a visa to travel abroad can all feel like rigmarole. In the 1700s, <i>rigmarole</i> meant ""a long rambling discourse."" It's thought to be a shortened form of <i>ragman roll</i>, which was a long legal document sewn into a roll in thirteenth century England and Scotland."
Riparian,"<i>Riparian</i> refers to anything located on or related to the banks of a river, such as <i>riparian</i> wildlife.<br><br>The roots of the word <i>riparian</i> are related to rivers, and that's exactly what this word refers to: riparian things have something to do with the banks of a river or stream. A person selling fishing lures by the river has a riparian business. A frog that lives by the river bank is a riparian critter. A riparian state is located alongside a river."
Riposte 1.,"A <i>riposte</i> is a clever comeback, one of those witty responses that you usually think after the fact — when it's too late to say them.<br><br>Winston Churchill was famous for his skill with a riposte, like when his friend Lady Astor said that if he were her husband, she'd poison his tea, and he responded, ""If you were my wife, I'd drink it!"" This kind of quick, funny retort is a classic riposte. Originally, the word <i>riposte</i> came from a French word for a certain kind of lunge in fencing, and it still has this same meaning today."
Rivet 1.,"A <i>rivet</i> is a metal fastener, a bolt-like device that holds together two pieces of metal or fabric. The round metal fasteners on your favorite pair of jeans are <i>rivets</i>.<br><br>Older buildings with metal frames like the Eiffel Tower are held together with rivets, and so are some bridges and military vehicles. Furniture upholstery often involves rivets, too. When you use a rivet to fasten, you can say you <i>rivet</i> — and similarly, to hold attention or captivate is also to <i>rivet</i>. The Old French root is <i>river</i>, ""to clench or fasten."""
Rivet 2.,"A <i>rivet</i> is a metal fastener, a bolt-like device that holds together two pieces of metal or fabric. The round metal fasteners on your favorite pair of jeans are <i>rivets</i>.<br><br>Older buildings with metal frames like the Eiffel Tower are held together with rivets, and so are some bridges and military vehicles. Furniture upholstery often involves rivets, too. When you use a rivet to fasten, you can say you <i>rivet</i> — and similarly, to hold attention or captivate is also to <i>rivet</i>. The Old French root is <i>river</i>, ""to clench or fasten."""
Ruminate,"When you <i>ruminate</i>, it means you are thinking very deeply about something. You're likely to be so lost in thought that you stare off into space and don't hear people when they call your name.<br><br>Another meaning of <i>ruminate</i> is to ""chew the cud,"" which can mean ""to turn it over and over in your mind."" Or, if you're a cow, to turn food over and over in your stomachs in order to digest it. Whether you're a human or a cow, if you ruminate, it will take a LONG time."
Rumination,"If someone asks you to make a difficult decision — like what to have for dinner — it might lead to <i>rumination</i>, or a long period of deep thought.<br><br>Use the noun <i>rumination</i> when there's thoughtful consideration going on. If your grandfather answers every question by saying, ""Hmm. Let me think about that,"" he is a fan of rumination. It comes from the verb <i>ruminate</i>, which means ""to think deeply,"" but also means ""to chew the cud."" Both words come from the Latin word <i>ruminatus</i>, which has the same meaning and which is rooted in <i>rumen</i>, or ""gullet."""
Sagacious,"Use the formal adjective <i>sagacious</i> to describe someone who is wise and insightful like an advisor to the president or a Supreme Court justice.<br><br>Someone like an inspirational leader or an expert in a field who seeks knowledge and has foresight can be described as sagacious. If you comment on something at a deeper level, you are making a sagacious observation. The word is a descendent of Latin <i>sagus</i> ""prophetic"" and is related to the Old English word <i>seek</i>. Synonyms include <i>discerning</i>, <i>insightful</i> and another formal word <i>perspicacious</i>."
Sage,"Use the word <i>sage</i> for someone or something wise and judicious. Thanks to the <i>sage</i> advice of your friend, you didn't write your teacher an angry e-mail!<br><br>Although you might think of a wizard when you hear the word <i>sage</i>, really it means a wise man. Today you see it used to refer to someone who has insight in a particular field. If someone is a policy sage, he knows just what advice to give politicians to make them understand the issue and respond successfully to it. In a totally unrelated use, there is also a plant called sage that is useful in home remedies and cooking."
Salient,"If something stands out in a very obvious way, it can be called <i>salient.</i> It's time to find new friends if the differences between you and your current friends are becoming more and more <i>salient</i>.<br><br><i>Salient,</i> from the Latin verb <i>salire</i> ""to leap,"" was originally used in English to refer to leaping animals such as a frog or deer and may still be used this way. Often, however, it is used in math or geography to mean protruding. A salient angle juts outward rather than inward. Figuratively, it means noticeable or prominent. When giving an argument, make your most salient points at the beginning or the end."
Salutary,"Use <i>salutary</i> to describe something that's good for your health, like the <i>salutary</i> benefits of exercise, laughter, and getting enough sleep every night.<br><br>When you look at the word <i>salutary</i>, you might expect it to have something to do with showing respect to military personnel, perhaps by saluting. In fact, <i>salutary</i> and <i>salute</i> do share a Latin root: <i>salus</i>, which means ""good health."" When you salute someone, or say ""Salud!"" before clinking glasses and taking a first sip, you're essentially giving your salutary wish — in other words, hoping a person enjoys good health."
Salve,"A <i>salve</i> is something that soothes. You can use an ointment as a <i>salve</i> for an itchy rash, or maybe your kind words can act as a <i>salve</i> to comfort a heartsick friend.<br><br>In some parts of the world, people pronounce <i>salve</i> the way it's spelled, but in the U.S. the correct pronunciation has a silent <i>L</i>. You can use this word for things that make people feel better — not just ointment: ""A hot cup of tea is a <i>salve</i> for me."" And you can also use it as a verb: ""The nurse will <i>salve</i> your wounds now."" <i>Salve</i> comes from a Proto-Indo-European root that means ""fat"" or ""butter."""
Salvo,"A <i>salvo</i> is when troops fire their guns all at the same time. A <i>salvo</i> of shots might signal the beginning of a military battle.<br><br>Another word for the gunfire kind of <i>salvo</i> is a ""volley."" Military planners have used salvos as a way to overwhelm an opposing army, including during engagements between battleships and tanks. You can also use <i>salvo</i> in a more figurative way, describing a verbal barrage or attack: ""Her direct, almost rude questions were seen as the opening <i>salvo</i> in the battle between the two political candidates."""
Saturated,"<i>Saturated</i> means drenched and full. When you fish out a slice of bread that’s fallen into your water glass and find it’s disgustingly spongy and waterlogged, it’s <i>saturated</i>.<br><br><i>Saturated</i> originally meant “satisfied,"" but by the 1700s it could mean “soaked thoroughly.” In the twentieth century it developed marketing connotations, as in a <i>saturated</i> market — one without room for competition. In chemistry, <i>saturated</i> refers to an organic compound, like a fatty acid, that contains the highest number of hydrogen atoms possible. When it comes to color, <i>saturated</i> means pure, or undiluted with white, grey, or black."
Scabbard,"A <i>scabbard</i> is a sheath for a sword, dagger, or other type of knife. Some cooks wear their French knives in a <i>scabbard</i> so they'll be ready to chop no matter where they are in the kitchen.<br><br>You’ve probably seen a <i>scabbard</i> in an older movie. The hero sheaths his sword in a long wooden, metal or leather scabbard hanging from his belt. The origins of the word, however, are not that manly. <i>Scabbard</i> comes from an old Germanic compound meaning ""blade protector."""
Scant,"<i>Scant</i> is an adjective that means ""a tiny amount,"" like your <i>scant</i> attendance at practice this week that results in being benched from the big game.<br><br><i>Scant</i> is also a verb, that means ""to supply sparingly"" — don't scant with the brownies, or I will keep asking for more. <i>Scant</i> also means ""to deal with inadequately or carelessly."" When you scant the reports on homelessness, they are so superficial on data that they don't reflect the real problem. <i>Scant</i> comes from the Old Norse word <i>skamt,</i> meaning ""short, brief."""
Scorn,"<i>Scorn</i> is open disrespect for someone or something. It can also be disrespect coupled with feelings of intense dislike.<br><br>The noun <i>scorn</i> describes your feelings of disdain when you encounter something you view as worthless or inferior — like, for instance, a talk show that gets all its facts wrong. Use the verb form for those times when you’re actively expressing scorn. You might scorn a politician who spends $100,000 on travel while claiming to work hard promoting middle-class values."
Scuttle,"When you <i>scuttle</i>, you move with quick anxious steps, like a bug running for cover when a light is turned on.<br><br>Use the word <i>scuttle</i> when you want to describe running or fast walking that’s characterized by short, hasty steps, like someone or something that tries to hurry — a person who is late for work scuttling through a crowd of slow-moving pedestrians — but can't. It is also found in these well-known lines from T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"": ""I should have been a pair of ragged claws / Scuttling across the floors of silent seas."""
Seductive,"<i>Seductive</i> is an adjective that describes the fascinating magnetic pull that someone or something has, an attractive quality that tempts you in some way.<br><br>A seductive person catches your eye and won’t let it go.  The word comes from the Latin <i>seducere</i>, meaning “draw aside.”  When someone draws your attention aside from whatever you’re doing, that is a seductive person.  Radio people often have seductive voices that lull you to sleep, and stores put their most seductive items in the front window in hopes that you’ll be tempted to come inside and buy them."
Sermon,"A <i>sermon</i> is a speech, usually religious in nature, given by a priest, preacher, rabbi, or other religious leader as part of a service.<br><br>Although most sermons focus on Bible passages, you can use the word <i>sermon</i> more generally to refer to any speech that contains a moral lesson. Sports coaches are known to deliver moving sermons, as are teachers and camp counselors. But if you come in late, after missing your curfew, the last thing you want to hear is a sermon by your mom on the importance of keeping your word."
Shaky,"Something <i>shaky</i> is trembling — or just feels like it. When we're not confident, we feel <i>shaky</i>.<br><br>Being shaky is something that happens to us all. The first day of a job or class can make anyone feel shaky — even the teacher or boss. When you get extremely nervous, your hands might literally shake. That's not fun, but it might help you remember what <i>shaky</i> means. A building in an earthquake and a tree in the wind can also be shaky. One person we hope is not shaky — in either way — is a surgeon."
Sham,"A <i>sham</i> is a fake. If you frequently order products advertised on late-night, hour-long television commercials, you’ve probably ended up with at least one item that was a <i>sham</i>. All-purpose, industrial strength stain remover, anyone?<br><br><i>Sham</i> can be used to refer to people as well as to things. Remember that doctor from the late-night TV commercial advertising UltraMiracleCure vitamin pills? He’s probably a sham, or a quack. Some sources claim that the word <i>sham</i> originated in the 17th century and was derived from the English word <i>shame</i>, but who knows? Maybe that theory’s a sham too."
Shear 1.,"A <i>shear</i> is a cutting implement that looks like a long pair of scissors. Also like scissors, this form of the noun is usually plural. You can cut metal, prune a tree, or cut up a chicken with <i>shears</i>.<br><br>In farming, when you remove wool from a sheep, goat, or even a llama, you <i>shear</i> the animal. Most farmers shear their sheep once a year, but the timing varies from farm to farm. The verb <i>shear</i> also means to cause to break off or come apart with a cutting force. The wind during a storm can blow hard enough to shear the tiles off a roof."
Shear 2.,"A <i>shear</i> is a cutting implement that looks like a long pair of scissors. Also like scissors, this form of the noun is usually plural. You can cut metal, prune a tree, or cut up a chicken with <i>shears</i>.<br><br>In farming, when you remove wool from a sheep, goat, or even a llama, you <i>shear</i> the animal. Most farmers shear their sheep once a year, but the timing varies from farm to farm. The verb <i>shear</i> also means to cause to break off or come apart with a cutting force. The wind during a storm can blow hard enough to shear the tiles off a roof."
Sheer,"If people can see through your shirt, it's <i>sheer</i>. This can also mean something steep, like a cliff, or anything extreme, like <i>sheer</i> nerve.<br><br>This word has several meanings, but they're all extreme. A sheer (see-through) shirt is an extreme way to dress — climbing a sheer cliff is almost impossible. If your car sheers, it swerves sharply, and you might crash. Maybe you've met all these meanings in a single nightmare: When the sheer cloth blew over your face as you drove, you lost control and the car began to sheer, filling you with sheer terror as you went over the sheer cliff."
Shibboleth,"A <i>shibboleth</i> is like a motto or catchphrase that members of a group tend to say, like the conservative shibboleth that the only good government is a small government.<br><br><i>Shibboleth</i> comes all the way from Hebrew, and originally meant a special word that helped you find out if someone was part of your group, almost like a secret handshake. It still has that sense of identifying someone as a member of a group. Sometimes it also means ""platitude"" or ""truism,"" a phrase that is so common everyone thinks it's true, like ""crime doesn't pay,"" or ""all dogs go to heaven."""
Shingle 1.,"A <i>shingle</i> is a thin piece of wood used in making a roof or a signboard outside an office, especially a doctor’s or lawyer's. If you’re opening a business, hang your <i>shingle</i> outside so people can find you.<br><br>One kind of shingle is a rectangular piece of wood or other material used to make a roof. The other is a type of small sign outside an office that shows someone is ready to see clients, patients, or other types of customers. The word <i>shingle</i> is from the Latin <i>scindere</i> for ""to split,” as in splitting wood, and whatever you do with a shingle, it’s a small flat hunk of wood."
Shingle 2.,"A <i>shingle</i> is a thin piece of wood used in making a roof or a signboard outside an office, especially a doctor’s or lawyer's. If you’re opening a business, hang your <i>shingle</i> outside so people can find you.<br><br>One kind of shingle is a rectangular piece of wood or other material used to make a roof. The other is a type of small sign outside an office that shows someone is ready to see clients, patients, or other types of customers. The word <i>shingle</i> is from the Latin <i>scindere</i> for ""to split,” as in splitting wood, and whatever you do with a shingle, it’s a small flat hunk of wood."
Shoal,"The noun <i>shoal</i> can be used to refer to a group of fish or an area of shallow water. So when you’re navigating a <i>shoal</i> in your row boat, you might look down and see a <i>shoal</i> of fish swimming out of the way.<br><br>If you like to fish, you might know that <i>shoal</i> can refer to shallow water, but it can also describe a sandbank that you can only see when the water is low. Both  kinds of shoals are problems if you’re trying to navigate in a boat — you have to try not to run aground when you encounter either one. The word also has a verb form as well that describes water that gets shallow: it shoals."
Shoddy,"<i>Shoddy</i> refers to poor materials or quality. Maybe you passed on buying a house because it leaned in an odd way and various and sundry parts were falling off. Sounds like both the materials and workmanship were <i>shoddy</i>.<br><br><i>Shoddy</i> originally referred to something that looked high-quality but wasn’t. Later, a certain type of cloth made with leftover pieces and rags was called a <i>shoddy</i>. While <i>shoddy</i> often refers to materials or workmanship, questionable ethics can also be referred to as shoddy, as in the shoddy principles of a slumlord or the shoddy morals of someone who steals from their friends."
Shrift,"Use the noun <i>shrift</i> to describe the act of confessing, especially to a priest.<br><br><i>Shrift</i> is an old-fashioned way to talk about the traditional religious ritual of confession and absolution. <i>Shrift</i> comes from the equally antique word <i>shrive</i>, which is what a priest does when he hears a confession. The phrase ""short <i>shrift</i>"" began as a description of the brief chance a condemned prisoner had to confess his sins before being put to death, and evolved to mean ""to dismiss with little consideration."""
Shrine,"Set up some candles and a photograph of someone important in your life in the corner of a room where you spend time reflecting silently, and you've created a <i>shrine</i>.<br><br><i>Shrine</i> comes from the Latin <i>scrinium</i> meaning ""case or box for keeping papers."" Think of a shrine as a niche or case in which the spirit of someone special is kept. It could be a statue or some other form of commemoration to either a person or a relic. A shrine can be as small as a tiny mantel in your house or it can be as massive as a building commemorating, or shrining, a sacred person."
Sickle,"A <i>sickle</i> is a tool with a handle and a curved metal blade that workers use for trimming grass or harvesting crops. Put a hammer next to a <i>sickle</i> and boom, there’s the symbol for communism.<br><br>Farmers use sickles to clear brush or cut grain crops by hand. In some parts of the world, sickles are also used as weapons and for cooking. The sickle often represents an agricultural working class, notably in the crossed hammer and sickle symbol of the former Soviet Union and current Communist and Socialist parties around the world. <i>Sickle</i> comes from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning ""to cut."""
Simpleton,"A <i>simpleton</i> is an idiot — a person without much common sense or intelligence.<br><br>This is one of many words — such as moron, dummy, and dimwit — that insult a person's intelligence. A simpleton is the opposite of a genius. However, the word <i>simple</i> implies more than lack of intelligence; it suggests being innocent or naive too. So a simpleton could be considered a hillbilly or yokel as well as a dullard or dunce."
Slab,"A <i>slab</i> is a great big thick piece of something. Your backyard patio, for example, might be made of a huge <i>slab</i> of concrete.<br><br>A sidewalk is often composed of one cement slab after another — these are sometimes called paving slabs. You could refer to large pieces of stone or wood as <i>slabs</i> too. Even your lunch might be a slab, if it's a thick hunk of cheesy pizza or a huge slab of bread slathered with peanut butter. The origins of the word <i>slab</i> are unknown, though we do know it's been around since the thirteenth century."
Slavish,"Someone who's <i>slavish</i> is either overly meek and obedient or copies someone else instead of thinking for themselves. If you write your story in the style of Ernest Hemingway, your English teacher may accuse you of <i>slavish</i> imitation.<br><br>In a dictatorship, rulers may expect citizens to be slavish, but in a democracy, no one should have to treat leaders in a slavish way. This meaning of <i>slavish</i> is the original 16th century one, from <i>slave</i>, ""person who is the property of another person."" The ""servilely imitative, lacking originality or independence"" meaning of <i>slavish</i> came later, around 1750."
Sleight,"The noun <i>sleight</i> refers to being able to use your hands with ease, especially when doing a trick. <i>Sleight</i> is often used in the phrase ""<i>sleight</i> of hand."" If you are a good magician, you can make a coin disappear with <i>sleight</i> of hand.<br><br>The noun <i>sleight</i> refers to cunning or cleverness, especially when used to trick or deceitfully. You can use a sleight of mind to trick yourself into believing that if you eat a box of cookies at dinnertime it counts as dinner. The word <i>sleight</i> with its meaning as being sneaky has a long history and comes from the Middle English word, <i>sleghth</i>, which also meant cunning. Back then people would have pronounced the ""gh"" even though today we don't."
Slovenly,"<i>Slovenly</i> is what your great aunt Mehitabel might call you if you came to high tea without a necktie. It means ""messy or unkempt,"" but is a word you probably won't hear messy or unkempt people using.<br><br><i>Slovenly</i> has meant messy or unkempt since the 1500s, but it had a brief heyday before that of meaning ""low or base."" This class association remains embedded in the word — someone who uses the word <i>slovenly</i> today is most likely also going to raise his or her pinky while drinking from a cup of tea."
Smarmy,"<i>Smarmy</i> describes someone who is overly flattering and fake. A <i>smarmy</i> student might tell a teacher, ""You're looking even more lovely than usual today,"" with a big smile.<br><br><i>Smarmy</i> describes someone who goes way over the top trying to be suave and charming — fooling no one. A smarmy car salesman will compliment your outfit and your hair and your taste in cars, always with an unpleasant falseness. In the 1930s, <i>smarm</i> was a verb that described smearing the hair with pomade, which makes it look shiny and slick. Back then, <i>smarm</i> also meant smearing with flattery."
Sojourn,"A <i>sojourn</i> is a short stay or visit. If you want a fancy way to say that you took a trip to the countryside, you might talk about your country <i>sojourn</i>.<br><br>The verb is originally from the Latin prefix <i>sub-</i> ""under"" plus <i>diurnus</i> ""of a day."" You might refer to your vacation as a <i>sojourn</i>, but it might make more sense if you are describing a trip to Provence rather than a trip to Disney World. Or In figurative use, <i>sojourn</i> means to delve––your math teacher may stop midway through lessons on fractions for a brief sojourn into techniques for slicing pie."
Solace,"If something eases your disappointment or grief, consider it a <i>solace</i>. If you're sad, you might find <i>solace</i> in music or in talking to your friends.<br><br>It is no surprise that <i>consolation</i> and <i>solace</i> are similar in meaning as they share a root in the Latin verb <i>sōlārī</i> ""to comfort."" In fact, <i>solace</i> and <i>consolation</i> are synonyms meaning relief from grief or disappointment. When you go to sleepaway camp, your parents will miss you, but they'll find solace in knowing that you are having fun."
Solecism,"Ever snore at the opera? Burp at the dinner table? Forget your mom's birthday? Probably all three, right? Well, don't worry. Instead of just screwing up, what you did was commit a <i>solecism.</i> Sounds kinda neat that way, huh?<br><br>The origin of <i>solecism</i> comes from the ancient Greek word meaning ""speaking incorrectly,"" and <i>solecism</i> does have another meaning that's more specifically verbal. If you say something incorrectly, or make a grammatical error in writing, that's also a solecism. It can be just as mortifying as burping at the dinner table. Well, almost."
Solipsism,"<i>Solipsism</i> is the philosophical theory that what's in your mind is the only reality that can be known and verified.<br><br><i>Solipsism</i> comes from the Latin words for alone (<i>sol</i>) and self (<i>ipse</i>), and means that only the self is real. In metaphysical solipsism, your mind is the only thing that's real, and everything else is just a representation. In epistemological solipsism, there might be a world outside your mind, which you could detect with your senses, but it's impossible to prove. In methodological solipsism the self is the only proper starting point for exploring the nature of reality."
Soluble,"Sugar is <i>soluble</i>. It dissolves easily in water. You can also use the word to describe a problem that can be solved easily.<br><br>How are the two definitions of <i>soluble</i> related? When you dissolve something in a liquid, the combination is known as a solvent or a solution. All of these ""sol-"" words descend from the Latin word that means loosen or unfasten. When you dissolve something in water, you loosen the molecules. And if you think of a problem like a knot, to solve it is to loosen it up."
Spastic,"A <i>spastic</i> motion is jerky and convulsive. This word also applies to people suffering from <i>spastic</i> paralysis.<br><br>Have you ever had a muscle spasm? Then you know what it's like to have a muscle move jerkily on its own. That kind of unpredictable, uncontrolled movement is called spastic. Anyone could have a spastic muscle briefly, but some people have spastic paralysis, in which their muscles are permanently out of their control and difficult to use. People with this condition have sometimes been called spastics, but that term is now offensive and should be avoided."
Sporadic,"<i>Sporadic</i> is an adjective that you can use to refer to something that happens or appears often, but not constantly or regularly. The mail carrier comes every day but the plumber's visits are <i>sporadic</i>––he comes as needed.<br><br>A specialized use of <i>sporadic</i> is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an <i>epidemic</i>.  English borrowed the word <i>sporadic</i> from Greek <i>sporadikós</i> ""scattered."" A very near synonym is <i>intermittent</i>."
Spurious,"Something false or inauthentic is <i>spurious</i>. Don't trust <i>spurious</i> ideas and stories. <i>Spurious</i> statements often are lies, just as a <i>spurious</i> coin is a counterfeit coin — a fake.<br><br>Anytime you see the word <i>spurious</i>, you're dealing with things that can't be trusted or accepted at face value. A spurious claim is one that's not backed up by the facts. A spurious argument relies on faulty reasoning — and maybe some lies. Politicians often accuse each other of saying things that are spurious and meant to deceive the voters. As long as you're honest, clear, and not trying to trick anyone, nobody can say you're being spurious."
Staccato,"<i>Staccato</i> is a musical term for notes that are played quickly and sharply. It can also refer to anything characterized by similar beats, such as the <i>staccato</i> clacking of a woman's high heels on a tile floor.<br><br>There is nothing quite so pleasant as lying in bed on a Saturday morning listening to the staccato tapping of rain on the roof, knowing that everything you had planned will now be canceled. Other staccato sounds are not so pleasant––your neighbor learning to play the drums, a jack hammer right outside your window."
Stammer,"To <i>stammer</i> — or to have a <i>stammer</i> — is to speak haltingly and to have trouble getting the words out. A <i>stammer</i> is also called a ""stutter.""<br><br>Stammering (or stuttering) has a couple of related meanings. A stammer is a serious problem for some people who have great difficulty speaking. They have trouble getting the words out, and their language does not flow. They might get stuck repeating one sound over and over again. This is a difficult problem to overcome. However, we all stammer sometimes, often because we're confused, scared, tired, or unsure of what to say."
Stance,"Your <i>stance</i> is your posture or the way you stand. Figuratively, if you take a <i>stance</i> against bullying, you are standing against it.<br><br>If you take a stance on a contentious issue, it means you believe strongly about it one way or the other. If your stance is unpopular, you'll need some courage to speak your mind. The word comes from the Italian <i>stanza</i> which means stopping place. Your stance is something that's not likely to change. You have stopped there, your decision is made. You're done."
Steeple,"A <i>steeple</i> is a very tall tower that gets smaller and smaller as it goes up. Many churches have <i>steeples</i>. <i>Steeples</i> are really tall so people can find the church from anywhere in town.<br><br>Steeples have been around since the Middle Ages. The word itself comes from Middle English for “high tower.” A steeple on top of a church or temple makes it stand out in a crowd, and it also points right up to heaven. There’s a steeple on almost every church, but if you want to see a really big one, check out the one on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris."
Sternum,"Your <i>sternum</i> is your breastbone, the flat plate at the top of your rib cage. Mammals and birds — and even arachnids, or spiders — have a <i>sternum</i>.<br><br>If you study human anatomy, you'll learn that the sternum is a long, flat, <i>T</i>-shaped bone made of fused segments. The rib cage attaches the sternum to the spine, or vertebrae. The word itself comes from the Greek <i>sternon</i>, ""chest, breast, or breastbone,"" from a root that means ""flat surface."""
Stilted,"The adjective <i>stilted</i> describes something—usually a style of writing or speaking—that is unnaturally formal.<br><br>Imagine someone walking awkwardly on a pair of stilts and you have a good impression of the word <i>stilted</i> — wooden and stiff. <i>Stilt</i> is found in the mid-15th century, referring to walking on wooden <i>stilts</i> across marshy ground. A hundred years later, the word <i>stilted</i> came to refer to the posts holding up a building. It wasn't until 1820 that the word was used as we use it now, to describe writing or speaking that does not flow smoothly."
Stint,"The noun <i>stint</i> means a set amount of time in which you do something — often work of some sort. ""She served a <i>stint</i> in the army, followed by a <i>stint</i> in an office setting, before settling on a career as a lounge singer.""<br><br>Unlike a project or vocation, a <i>stint</i> can refer to the stretch of time spent doing a particular job. You apply for a job, but you refer to your past stint in the Peace Corps. As a verb, <i>stint</i> means to be sparing or frugal, or restrict in a stingy manner (""to skimp""). ""The school board chose to make cuts at the administrative level, rather than <i>stint</i> on the children's education."""
Stipulate,"To <i>stipulate</i> something means to demand that it be part of an agreement. So when you make a contract or deal, you can <i>stipulate</i> that a certain condition must be met.<br><br>Anytime you draw up a legal agreement, you can stipulate a requirement that has to be met for that agreement to be complete. This stipulation might put some sort of limit on the agreement. For example, if you run a fencing company and offer a sale, you can stipulate that to get the sale price, the fence must be ordered by a certain date. Your customer, in turn, might stipulate that the work must be finished before the ground freezes."
Stipulation,"If all <i>stipulations</i> aren't met, the deal's off. By not reading the contract's  fine print, you overlooked the <i>stipulation</i> that you perform in a clown suit. At least you can juggle.<br><br>The Latin root of <i>stipulation</i> is <i>stipulat-</i>, meaning “demanded as a formal promise.” The judge might allow you to go free, with the stipulation that you never again go swimming in a public fountain. A nightly foot massage could be one of many stipulations detailed in your “dating agreement.” Right or left tonight?"
Straddle 1.,"When you <i>straddle</i> something, you're sitting on it with one leg on each side — like <i>straddling</i> a horse or a fence.<br><br>Unless you're using an old-fashioned side saddle, you straddle a horse when you ride it. Gymnasts learn how to straddle the parallel bars, basically doing the splits on them. But if someone says you're ""straddling the fence"", it means you're doing a different kind of splits: you're not taking a side and refusing to commit. In finance, straddling means you want to leave your options open to buy or sell."
Straddle 2.,"When you <i>straddle</i> something, you're sitting on it with one leg on each side — like <i>straddling</i> a horse or a fence.<br><br>Unless you're using an old-fashioned side saddle, you straddle a horse when you ride it. Gymnasts learn how to straddle the parallel bars, basically doing the splits on them. But if someone says you're ""straddling the fence"", it means you're doing a different kind of splits: you're not taking a side and refusing to commit. In finance, straddling means you want to leave your options open to buy or sell."
Stratum,"A <i>stratum</i> is a layer of something, whether abstract, like a social <i>stratum</i> composed of only billionaires, or physical, like the different <i>strata</i> (that’s the plural version) of clouds that an airplane passes through.<br><br><i>Stratum</i> comes from the Latin meaning ""something that has been laid down,"" like asphalt or a bedsheet, but we generally use it to describe layers of something. If you go into geology, you will probably investigate different strata of the soil. If you start out in life poor and try to become rich, you are trying to get into a different social stratum."
Stringent,"That teacher's demands are <i>stringent</i> — she wants the homework typed in her favorite font, on special paper, and each essay must be exactly 45 lines!<br><br>While the word <i>stringent</i> might seem foreign, if you're afflicted with pimples, you'll know the word <i>astringent</i>. An astringent causes your skin to tighten like it's shrinking your pores. This tightening, constricting feel describes <i>stringent</i> with regard to rules. Stringent safety procedures prevent accidents in a dangerous work environment. And restaurants must adhere to stringent health regulations."
Strut 1.,"When you <i>strut</i>, you walk with a proud swagger that has a little arrogance thrown in, like the prance of a running back who has just flown past the 250-pound linebackers and planted the ball in the end zone.<br><br>You can't strut and be shy about it — when you strut, you know people are watching you. The big boss in a gangster film, a model on the runway, and the rap artist whose album has just gone platinum all know how to strut. The noun form of <i>strut</i> has a little less flash and refers to a vertical or horizontal support that holds something up, like the long steel bars holding up a building."
Strut 2.,"When you <i>strut</i>, you walk with a proud swagger that has a little arrogance thrown in, like the prance of a running back who has just flown past the 250-pound linebackers and planted the ball in the end zone.<br><br>You can't strut and be shy about it — when you strut, you know people are watching you.

The noun form of <i>strut</i> has a little less flash and refers to a vertical or horizontal support that holds something up, like the long steel bars holding up a building."
Stupendous,"<i>Stupendous</i> means amazing or awesome. You just won a million dollars and are donating it to charity? That’s <i>stupendous</i>!<br><br>While you might think of <i>stupid</i> as a mean word for someone who isn’t smart, it can also mean senseless or stunned. If something stuns you so much that you are amazed, it is stupendous. Think of a stupendous performance or stupendous scenery. When something is big enough to astound, also use this word. The tower rose to a stupendous height. It would take a stupendous effort to improve your D in history to an A!"
Subcutaneous,"The adjective <i>subcutaneous</i> is a medical term that describes anything that exists or is inserted just below the skin.<br><br>Unfortunately, you're most likely to hear the word <i>subcutaneous</i> at the hospital or doctor's office when you're just about to get a shot. The word itself is made up of <i>sub</i>, which is ""under"" in Latin, and <i>cutaneous</i>, which comes from <i>cutis</i>, meaning ""skin."" The only actual synonym for <i>subcutaneous</i> is <i>hypodermic</i>, which also usually describes a needle that is inserted below the skin."
Subjugate,"If you say you won't be kept down by the man, you are saying that you won't let the man <i>subjugate</i> you. To <i>subjugate</i> is to repress someone, or to make them subservient to you.<br><br>In <i>subjugate</i> you see the word <i>subject</i>. In this word, it's not talking about the <i>subject</i> of a sentence, rather it's talking about the kind of <i>subjects</i> that Kings have serving them. <i>Subjugate</i> is to reduce someone's status to that of a <i>subject</i>. It's a royal demotion, often brought by force or intimidation."
Sublime,"In common use, <i>sublime</i> is an adjective meaning ""awe-inspiringly grand, excellent, or impressive,"" like the best chocolate fudge sundae you've ever had.<br><br>You might describe a spine-tingling piece of music as ""a work of <i>sublime</i> beauty."" With <i>the</i>, the word also functions as a noun meaning ""something that strikes the mind with a sense of grandeur or power"": ""Never need an American look beyond his own country for the <i>sublime</i> and beautiful of natural scenery,"" wrote Washington Irving. The beauty of music or nature can be awe-inspiring, but <i>sublime</i> is also useful for describing everything from an impressive serve in tennis to a jaw-droppingly good taste sensation."
Sullen,"A bad-tempered or gloomy person is <i>sullen</i>. <i>Sullen</i> people are down in the dumps.<br><br>If someone is dark, dour, glum, moody, morose, or sour, they're also sullen. Teenagers are often described as <i>sullen</i>, especially when they're being grumpy and silent. You often hear about ""a <i>sullen</i> silence,"" which is when someone is quiet, but obviously in a lousy mood. If a sullen person is talking, they're probably not saying much, and they might not be doing much beyond grunting. A sullen person isn't much fun to be around."
Sumptuous,"<i>Sumptuous</i> could be used to describe a room appointed with the finest furniture, a lush orchestra playing a beautiful symphony, or a meal meant for a king. <i>Sumptuous</i> describes something that costs a lot and imparts sensory pleasure.<br><br><i>Sumptuous</i> comes from the Latin <i>sumptus</i> which means expensive. <i>Sumptus</i> is related to <i>sumere</i> which means to consume. The word <i>sumptuous</i> carries both meanings with it. It is a pricey, high quality thing that's meant to be consumed or enjoyed. You wouldn't use <i>sumptuous</i> to describe a tractor, even if has leather seats and cost more than your house."
Superfluous,"When something is so unnecessary that it could easily be done away with, like a fifth wheel on a car or a fifth person on a double date, call it <i>superfluous</i>.<br><br><i>Superfluous</i> (soo-PER-floo-uhs) means ""more than required."" Use it when pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from the quality of something: ""For a climb over a glacier, the very thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems <i>superfluous</i> to me,"" wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899. The word comes from Latin and literally means ""overflowing"": <i>super</i>, ""over"" + <i>fluere</i>, ""to flow."" So you can think of a superfluous addition as flowing over the boundaries of what's needed."
Supine,"You can be described as <i>supine</i> when you're lying face up — for example, your favorite yoga poses might be the <i>supine</i> ones. Someone who is very passive or lethargic could also be called <i>supine</i> — for instance, someone might be <i>supine</i> in the face of continuous threats and insults.<br><br>The adjective <i>supine</i> comes from a Latin word, <i>supinus</i>, which means “thrown backwards” or “inactive.”  Whenever a person or animal is lying on its back, belly-up, it is <i>supine</i>.  When your hand is open, palm-up, it is also <i>supine</i>.  <i>Supine</i> can even describe a person who gives insufficient resistance, or who is lazy and ineffectual. ""When Jack refused to object to the landlord’s repeated — and gouging — rent increases, he was <i>supine</i>."""
Supplant,"Kate was out sick for a month with mono, and when she came back to school, Jessie had <i>supplanted</i> her as the funny girl at the lunch table. <i>Supplant</i> means to take the place of.<br><br>Being <i>supplanted</i> is something that often happens to ideas or ways of thinking. Encouraging children's freedom has supplanted old ideas about children being better seen than heard. After a shocking upset at Wimbledon, a new tennis player has supplanted the reigning champion."
Supplemental,"You can use the adjective <i>supplemental</i> to describe something extra. You could volunteer to donate your collection of markers and colored pencils to a local school that needs <i>supplemental</i> art supplies.<br><br>Something that's supplemental is added when there's a lack or deficiency. You might feed the runt from a litter of puppies supplemental milk because he can't get enough from his mother. Teachers are famous for assigning supplemental reading to round out the information in a textbook. <i>Supplemental</i> comes from the Latin <i>supplementum</i>, ""added to supply a deficiency."""
Supplementary,"<i>Supplementary</i> is a little something extra to fill in a gap, like when your teacher suggests <i>supplementary</i> reading material that you may or may not get around to checking out.<br><br><i>Supplementary</i> can be an important part of something or just extra support. The word <i>supplement</i> comes from the Latin <i>supplementum</i> for ""something added to fix a deficiency"" and the suffix <i>-ary</i> means ""connected with."" Put them together and you have something connected with filling in. The supplementary support of digging a moat around your sand castle might save it from a wave, but that supplementary reading on your syllabus isn't required (although it might save your grade)."
Supposition,"A <i>supposition</i> is a guess or a hypothesis. Your <i>supposition</i> that your kids will automatically wash their hands before dinner is probably false. You'd best remind them to do it or risk dirty hands at dinner.<br><br>What's the difference between an <i>assumption</i> and a <i>supposition</i> — both nouns that are often taken as synonyms for each other? An assumption is an idea or theory that is usually made without proof. A supposition, on the other hand, has the connotation that the idea or theory is testable and provable. If you are to meet someone named Hunter, you may make the assumption that you are meeting a man. But if you know that Hunter lives in an all-female dorm, you may have the supposition that Hunter is a woman."
Surly,"<i>Surly</i> describes behavior nobody wants to be around. Think of the irritable old guy who lives on your street and always seems to be simmering with some sullen nasty anger, whose every utterance he spits out with a rude snarl. He's the poster boy for <i>surly</i>.<br><br><i>Surly</i> behavior is always frowned upon, but the word's origins are in the behavior of English nobility. <i>Surly's</i> roots are in <i>sirly</i>, as in <i>sir</i>, meaning arrogant, haughty and superior. Its current meaning implies all that and more, none of it appealing. To be rude, snotty, sullen, mean and cranky can be added to the list. Generally speaking, if you find yourself in a <i>surly</i> mood, avoid your friends and loved ones."
Surmount,"If you <i>surmount</i> a challenge or difficult situation, you're not just getting over it. You're outdoing yourself, exceeding expectations, and overcoming the task at hand.<br><br>This word comes to us from the Old French verb for <i>mount</i>, or climb. Maria sang ""climb every mountain..."" in The Sound of Music. But she could have just as well meant ""<i>surmount</i> every obstacle"" — because to <i>surmount</i> means to both reach the highest point of something, like a mountain, and to totally overcome a mountain-size problem."
Suture,"If your energetic dog gets his paws on your beloved teddy bear, and you don’t realize it until it’s too late, you might have to use a needle and thread to <i>suture</i> Teddy’s left arm back onto his body.<br><br>Derived from the Latin <i>sutura,</i> which means “a sewing together,” the word <i>suture</i> can function as both a verb and a noun. Teddy’s situation aside, this word almost always refers to stitches performed on the human body. To suture is to stitch up a wound or incision. When used as a noun, it can refer to either the thread used for the stitching or the seam that is created by this process."
Swarthy,"<i>Swarthy</i> means dark skinned. If you like tall, dark and handsome men, you find a <i>swarthy</i> complexion attractive.<br><br>Not everyone with dark skin is swarthy. The word is usually used to describe someone whose skin is weather beaten and darkened by the sun, or has an olive complexion. But the famous 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman, who was of English and Dutch stock, seemed to be describing himself in his poem ""Behold This <i>Swarthy</i> Face,"" so swarthy may be in the eyes of the beholder."
Swerve,"The noun <i>swerve</i> means a sudden turn off your path. As a verb, it means to move off your original route, possibly to avoid a collision. You can <i>swerve</i> either toward something or away from it.<br><br>The word <i>swerve</i> can be traced to the Old English <i>sweorfan</i>, ""to turn aside,"" which is precisely the modern sense. It was first used as a verb in the 13th century and as a noun in the 18th. <i>Swerve</i> refers to a sudden veering off, perhaps not as sharp as a turn, but more a bending of your path. Think of the trajectory as an arc or curve, and remember that <i>swerve</i> rhymes with <i>curve</i>."
Swindle,"To <i>swindle</i> is to cheat or steal. You can <i>swindle</i> money, goods, ideas, and anything else that can be stolen, but be careful, because someone can also <i>swindle</i> you.<br><br>In the late 1700s, the verb <i>swindle</i> formed from <i>swindler</i>, which means “giddy person, cheat.” <i>Swindle</i> can be a noun or a verb. When you get something by less than honest means, that’s a swindle. A successful act of swindle often involves some scheme or rigging of the system. Hollywood loves a good swindle — think of all the movies that show a bank robbery or people lying about who they are.  Another funny word for <i>swindle</i> is <i>bamboozle</i>."
Sycophant,"A <i>sycophant</i> is a person who tries to win favor from wealthy or influential people by flattering them. Also known as brown-nosers, teacher's pets or suck-ups.<br><br><i>Sycophant</i> is from Latin <i>sycophanta,</i> from Greek <i>sykophantēs,</i> from <i>sykon</i> ""fig"" and <i>phainein</i> ""to show, make known."" The original sense was that of an informer, a person who gives information about criminal activities. ""Showing the fig"" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers. The gesture was used to taunt an opponent or to make an accusation against someone."
Synergy,"You write the lyrics and your friend composes the music. Separately each of you is pretty good, but together you’ve got a mega-hit song. That’s <i>synergy</i> — working together to create something greater than either of you could do alone.<br><br>The word <i>synergy</i> comes from the Greek <i>sun</i> “together” and <i>ergon</i> “work” (the same root that gives us <i>ergonomic</i> and <i>energy</i>).  When one thing magnifies the effect of another, together they have synergy. If your company makes some revolutionary kind of yo-yo, you may decide to acquire a company that distributes toys, as you’d expect there would be a natural synergy: each company will benefit from the other’s strengths, and together they’ll be stronger than either would be by itself."
Tandem,"<i>Tandem</i> describes an arrangement where people or animals are in formation, one behind the other. Couples attached at the hip sometimes like to ride <i>tandem</i> bicycles, which allow two people to pedal the same bike. How cute.<br><br>In 1785, <i>tandem</i> first came into existence as a noun meaning “carriage pulled by horses harnessed one behind the other.” About a hundred years later, people started to use <i>tandem</i> to refer to bicycles with two seats. This type of bicycle has two sets of pedals and two seats, but only one set of wheels. To transform <i>tandem</i> into an adverb, just stick <i>in</i> in front of it. ""In <i>tandem</i>"" can just mean ""together"" — like two departments working in tandem on a project."
Tantamount,"When something is <i>tantamount</i> to another thing it is essentially its equivalent. For some animal activists, wearing fur is <i>tantamount</i> to murder.<br><br><i>Tantamount</i> often refers to an action or thing being compared to another greater action or quality, as in, “Missing your finals is <i>tantamount</i> to dropping out of college.” While the two sides are essentially equal, you would not say, ""Dropping out of school is <i>tantamount</i> to missing your finals.” A related word is <i>paramount</i>, which means “the highest” or “primary.”"
Taper,"To <i>taper</i> is to gradually grow smaller or more narrow or less intense. <i>Taper</i> is often used with the word ""off."" Part of the power of the Vietnam Memorial is in how the two walls appear to ""<i>taper</i> off"" into infinity.<br><br>It's a rare breed of person who can keep fighting for days and days and days. For most people, the desire for battle <i>tapers</i> off with time and exhaustion. The derivation of the word <i>taper</i> from the Latin <i>papyrus</i> is interesting but takes a while to explain. Your interest would taper off before I finished explaining it. The fact that a road appears to taper off into the distance is an optical illusion: It doesn't actually get narrower. It just appears to taper off."
Tapestry,"A <i>tapestry</i> is a picture woven into cloth. It's a decorative rug you hang on the wall, with detailed images or designs on it. Some tapestries, like the famous Unicorn Tapestries, tell stories with their pictures.<br><br>Weaving an image into cloth is a brilliant idea — it makes art accessible and portable. And a tapestry offers something a painting can't: warmth. Think of those cold castle walls in medieval Europe, add a tapestry, and you're warmer already. You can use <i>tapestry</i> to describe anything that's multi-layered and complex, like the tapestry of life in a rural town, or the tapestry of your family history, or the tapestry of plot and character in your favorite novel."
Tart,"A <i>tart</i> is small pie filled with fruit or custard, with no top crust, like the cherry <i>tarts</i> you bought at the bakery.<br><br>As an adjective, <i>tart</i> describes a sour taste, like lemon, or harsh words, like your friend's tart reply to a question that makes her mad. In the 19th century, <i>tart</i> was British slang for ""pretty woman."" Some believe it is a shortening of ""sweetheart."" But by the end of that century, <i>tart</i> described a prostitute, something many language scholars trace back to the tart that you get at the bakery."
Tawdry,"<i>Tawdry</i> means cheap, shoddy, or tasteless. It can be used to describe almost anything from clothes to people to even events or affairs.<br><br>You know that shiny black slip you picked up for nothing at a garage sale and used as the skirt of your lion-tamer Halloween costume? It's a bit tawdry. But it would really be tawdry if you wore it on a regular day out. Tawdry things often have a hint of desperation and immorality — like tawdry extramarital affairs or tawdry tales. With tawdry decorations and jewelry, quality has been exchanged for lots of flash and shine."
Taxonomy,"<i>Taxonomy</i> is all about organizing and classifying. To make it sound more scientific, you could refer to your project of reorganizing your spice rack according to smell as a <i>taxonomy</i> of spices.<br><br><i>Taxonomy</i> is a word used mainly in biology to talk about classifying living organisms, organizing them according to their similarities. If you've ever seen a chart with animals divided into <i>species</i>, <i>genus</i>, and <i>family</i>, you know what scientific taxonomy is. The word comes very straightforwardly from Greek words for ""arrangement"" — <i>taxis</i> — and ""method"" — <i>nomia</i>. So any special method for arranging or organizing things can be called <i>taxonomy</i>."
Tempestuous,"A tempest is a storm, so you can use the adjective <i>tempestuous</i> to describe anything stormy or volatile — from a <i>tempestuous</i> hurricane to a <i>tempestuous</i> romance.<br><br>The adjective <i>tempestuous</i> can describe violent weather, but it can also figuratively describe something that just has the characteristics of such blustery and turbulent weather. A person could be described as <i>tempestuous</i> if she’s prone to violent mood swings and fits of passion. <i>Impetuous</i> is a synonym. The author Joseph Conrad once wrote, “To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and <i>tempestuous</i> existence.”"
Temporal,"Our time on earth is limited, or <i>temporal</i>.<br><br><i>Temporal</i> comes from the Latin word <i>temporalis</i> which means ""of time"" and is usually applied to words that mean not having much of it, such as the <i>temp</i> who works at an office for a set amount of time, because <i>temporary</i> situations don't last long. A less common word, <i>temporality</i> also means having limited time, and it rhymes with mortality! (Don't remind us.) <i>Temporal</i> implies ""of this earth,"" too — <i>temporal</i> boundaries keep us from being able to fly around the clouds, but spiritual beings can zing around at will. <i>Temporal</i> can also refer to temples, the ones on the side of your head that are probably aching by now."
Tendon,"If you feel the back of your ankle, you will find the tough, ropelike <i>tendon</i> that joins your calf muscle to your heel bone. That's the job of tendons throughout your body: connecting bone and muscle so you can move.<br><br>Consider that the Latin word <i>tendere</i> means ""to stretch."" That's an apt beginning for the word <i>tendon</i>, a tough but stretchy fibrous tissue (sinew). A tendon is made of dense bundles of fibrous collagen that form ropelike connectors that allow muscles and bones to work together. Athletes often suffer injuries to tendons, most often to the rotator cuff in the shoulder, the Achilles tendon in the leg, the patellar tendon in the knee, and the biceps muscle in the arm."
Tenet,"A <i>tenet</i> is a principle or belief honored by a person or, more often, a group of people. ""Seek pleasure and avoid pain"" is a basic <i>tenet</i> of Hedonism. ""God exists"" is a <i>tenet</i> of most major religions.<br><br><i>Tenet</i> is pronounced ""ten’it."" The word evolved from the Latin <i>tenere</i> ""to hold."" The noun <i>tenet</i> is an opinion or doctrine one holds. It usually refers to a philosophy or a religion, but it doesn't have to — for instance, Eastern medicine has different tenets from Western medicine. One of the central tenets of succeeding in the workplace is that a good offense is the best defense."
Tepid,"<i>Tepid</i> means lukewarm or half-hearted. If the applause for your mime-on-a-unicycle performance was more <i>tepid</i> than enthusiastic, it might be time to find a new hobby.<br><br>Around 1400, the word <i>tepid</i> evolved from the Latin <i>tepidus</i>, an adjective meaning “lukewarm,” which before that came about from the Latin <i>tepere</i>, a verb meaning “to be warm.” <i>Tepid</i> people or things are lukewarm or lacking in enthusiasm or emotion. Bathwater that’s been sitting in the tub for two hours is probably tepid. So was the hug you gave your least favorite ex when you ran into him at the movie theater."
Tertiary,"<i>Tertiary</i> is another way of saying ""third in importance,"" like socializing with co-workers being a <i>tertiary</i> reason for getting an after-school job — less important than, first, earning money and second, gaining skills.<br><br>To correctly pronounce <i>tertiary</i>, say ""TER-she-err-ee."" If you are the third child born in your family, don't be tempted to call yourself the ""tertiary child."" This means you are less important that your two older siblings. However, in some cases, <i>tertiary</i> does not have to do with ranking third — the Tertiary period marks the beginning of life for mammals, and in the United Kingdom, tertiary education means ""college-level."""
Thoroughfare,"A <i>thoroughfare</i> is a public road that can get you from one place to another. When it snows, plows try to remove the snow from the <i>thoroughfares</i> so the school busses can take everyone to school. You’re welcome.<br><br>This somewhat old-fashioned word has a very common meaning — a public road that goes from point A to point B. The word is made up of <i>thorough</i>, Old English for basically, “through” and <i>fare</i> for “journey.” (<i>Fare</i> also now means a payment, but not in <i>thoroughfare</i>.) If a road is private, like a driveway, it’s not a thoroughfare. This word often appears in the phrase ""no <i>thoroughfare</i>,"" which means there isn't a public route available."
Throng,"A <i>throng</i> is a crowd of people or animals. On the crowded platform, the <i>throng</i> of passengers attempted to push their way into the already overcrowded subway car.<br><br>When used as a noun, <i>throng</i> means a tightly packed crowd of people or animals. As a verb, it means to push together or squeeze into an area. The science fiction movie fans thronged into the auditorium when they heard their favorite actor had entered the building. The word comes to us from the Middle English term meaning ""push"" or ""force one's way,"" which is exactly what you'd have to do if you got stuck inside a throng of people."
Thwart,"A villain's worst nightmare is the superhero who always seems to <i>thwart</i> his efforts, preventing him from carrying out his plans to take over the world.<br><br><i>Thwart</i> is a word you'll hear in a lot of action movies, and usually it's the hero who is trying to thwart the evil plan of some super-villain. Yet even mere mortals can be thwarted in their efforts; the word simply means to prevent someone from carrying out his or her plans. An aggressive driver can thwart your attempt to snag a parking space at a crowded mall by pulling into the space before you. An aggressive shopper at that same mall can thwart your efforts to buy the last Dancing Snoopy doll by grabbing it off the shelf first."
Timber,"<i>Timber!</i> That's the call of warning you hear before a tree falls. That's because those lumberjacks are going to use the tree to make <i>timber</i>, otherwise known as ""lumber"" or the wood used for construction.<br><br><i>Timber</i> can actually be the trees used to make or build something, or the wood that comes from those trees, which you could also call ""lumber."" You might think that when a pirate yells ""shiver me <i>timbers</i>!"" he's referring to his wooden peg leg. But the timbers he's talking about are actually the boards and planks used to build the frame of a ship."
Tithe,"To <i>tithe</i> is to make a contribution equal to one-tenth of your income, usually to a church or religious institution. Devout church-goers usually <i>tithe</i>, even in years when their finances are very tight.<br><br><i>Tithe</i> comes from the Old English word <i>teogotha</i>, which means “tenth.” To tithe is to relinquish one-tenth of your personal income, either as a mandatory contribution, a voluntary donation, or as a levy. In ancient times farmers were required to tithe a portion of their crops. You may suspect that some of the wealthiest members of your church don’t really tithe as expected."
Torpor,"<i>Torpor</i> is a state of mental and physical inactivity. ""After a huge Thanksgiving meal, my family members fall into a <i>torpor</i>; no one can even pick up the TV remote.""<br><br><i>Torpor</i> can be used in everyday speech, but it's also a scientific term for a state of deep sleep that allows animals to conserve energy. Certain species of bats, birds, and frogs rely on <i>torpor</i> for survival during tough times. While humans don't technically belong to this group of animals, they certainly appear to, especially after a large meal and on most Monday mornings."
Tout,"To <i>tout</i> means to praise, boast, or brag about. If you like to <i>tout</i> your skill as a skier, you tell people you can go down expert-level hills.<br><br>Sometimes parents will get into bragging wars about their children, each touting the accomplishments of his or her child. Sometimes the word means more of ""to claim."" The company touted the lotion as a solution to wrinkles. Broccoli has been touted as the cancer-fighting vegetable. In England, a tout is a person who gives advice about gambling. If you're looking to play some money on the ponies, go see the tout who hangs out at Jackie’s bar for a tip."
Traipse,"To <i>traipse</i> is to walk around with a sloppy or aimless attitude. A bored high school student might <i>traipse</i> through a museum on a class trip, for example.<br><br>When you traipse, you trudge in an exhausted or reluctant way. Picture several kids dutifully following their dad along a hiking path or walking a mile to school, and you'll have a good idea of what <i>traipse</i> means. We've used the word since the 16th century, but its origin isn't certain. Some scholars think <i>traipse</i> comes from the French <i>trepasser</i>, ""to pass over,"" while others believe it started as an example of onomatopoeia, a word that sounds like what it means."
Transpire,"<i>Transpire</i> is a fancy way of saying ""happen."" You might go to a fortune teller to find out what will <i>transpire</i> in the future.<br><br>Originally used to express when information became known or came to light, many purists will tell you that's really the best way to use <i>transpire</i>. It can also mean releasing vapor into the air, like when a plant transpires water through its leaves on a hot day. Note: you'll usually encounter this word in its past tense: for example, ""We had to watch the replay to figure out what had <i>transpired</i>."""
Triage,"Grouping patients based on the severity of their injuries and the likelihood of their survival is called <i>triage</i>. In a <i>triage</i> situation, urgent cases are seen by doctors first, and non-life-threatening emergencies go last.<br><br>You can also apply the sorting and prioritizing of triage to more general situations. If you're overwhelmed with homework, you can perform triage by organizing it into subjects and prioritizing assignments based on their due dates. The word <i>triage</i> comes from the French word <i>trier</i> meaning to sort. Although the medical sense is now the most common, it wasn't used that way until World War One."
Tribulation,"<i>Tribulation</i> is suffering or trouble, usually resulting from oppression. The <i>tribulations</i> of a coal miner include a dangerous work environment, lung disease from black dust and a cramped, dark work space.<br><br>When you encounter the word <i>tribulation</i>, it will usually be in the company of the word <i>trial</i> as in, “She suffered many trials and <i>tribulations</i> as an early feminist.” The two words, while not identical, emphasize each other as they essentially mean testing and suffering. <i>Tribulation</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>tribulare</i> ""to oppress, afflict."""
Trifle,"A <i>trifle</i> is something that's totally unimportant. If your friend is freaking out over which shoes to buy and you call her dilemma a <i>trifle</i>, you're saying she shouldn't get so worked up over nothing.<br><br><i>Trifle</i> comes from the Middle English <i>trufle</i>, meaning ""fraud, joke, trick."" You'll usually hear it used to mean ""insignificant, trivial."" If you write a little ditty to sing at a birthday party, you could say it's just a trifle. As a verb, <i>trifle</i> means ""toy with, waste."" If you play with someone's feelings without seriously meaning anything, you are trifling with his affection. <i>Trifle</i> is also a sweet, sticky cake. Don't trifle the day away dreaming about trifle. Make some!"
Trinket,"The word <i>trinket</i> refers to an inexpensive, flashy ornament or piece of jewelry. A rhinestone brooch to pin to your jacket is a showy <i>trinket</i> that won't break the bank.<br><br>Trinkets aren't always made to be worn like jewelry. The word <i>trinket</i> can also refer to novelty items such as silly magnets with sayings on them or keepsake spoons. If you've ever stopped into a store at the airport that sells goods like keychains, mugs, and buttons, then you've seen trinkets. Trinkets are often purchased on a vacation — they're small enough to stick into your pockets before you board the plane home."
Tumultuous,"The adjective <i>tumultuous</i> means ""disruptive,"" ""troubled,"" ""disorderly,"" or ""turbulent.""<br><br>You might hear the adjective <i>tumultuous</i> in news stories about riots because it's one of the best words to describe a group of people in turmoil or disorder, but it can mean anything in a state of unrest. For example, you might steer your boat into a safe harbor before a heavy storm, so the <i>tumultuous</i> waves won't sweep you onto the rocks."
Ululate,"To <i>ululate</i> is to loudly howl or wail. Animals <i>ululate</i>, and so do people in pain.<br><br>This is an unusual-looking word, but it means something easy to understand: howling or wailing loudly. A lion will ululate. A person in pain will ululate. Coyotes and wolves — who are known for their howling — ululate. People who have their hearts broken might cry and ululate. Ululating could mean the animal or person is in pain, or maybe they’re trying to communicate something else. The key element is that it’s loud."
Unabashed,"To be <i>unabashed</i> is to be unembarrassed. When you're <i>unabashed</i>, you're confident and proud. You're letting it all hang out.<br><br><i>Unabashed</i> describes how good you feel about something. If you're an unabashed Red Sox fan, you're a proud Red Sox fan. If you're an unabashed patriot, you totally love your country — and wear clothing featuring bald eagles and the American flag. This word is the opposite of <i>abashed</i>, which means embarrassed. If you feel bad about something, then you really can't be unabashed."
Unassailable,"The adjective <i>unassailable</i> means without flaws or indefensible. If you are going to get home late (again!), you'd better have an <i>unassailable</i> alibi for your parents, or else you should plan on not seeing the outside of your room for a while.<br><br>The adjective <i>unassailable</i> also means immune to attack or doubt, such as an unassailable military holding or an unassailable reputation. <i>Unassailable</i> can also mean untouchable or unable to be defeated. If your high school basketball team is leading 92 to 14 with just a couple of seconds to go, the announcer might say you have an unassailable lead. The corrupt politician had so many connections, he seemed unassailable; he always seemed to manage to deflect even a hint of scandal onto others in the party."
Uncanny,"If something is <i>uncanny</i>, it is so mysterious, strange, or unfamiliar that it seems supernatural. If you hear strange music echoing through your attic, you might refer to it as positively <i>uncanny</i>.<br><br>You can also use <i>uncanny</i> to refer to something that is so remarkable that it is beyond what is natural: as in ""<i>uncanny</i> abilities."" This adjective was formed in English from the prefix <i>un-</i> ""not"" and <i>canny</i> ""fortunate, safe."" The current meaning of English <i>canny</i> is ""careful and clever, especially in handling money."""
Uncouth,"When you're at a fancy dinner party, if you burp after you eat, use your fingers to spread butter on your bread, and hang spoons from your nose, people will probably say you are <i>uncouth</i>, meaning vulgar and ill-mannered.<br><br>The adjective <i>uncouth</i> comes from Old English and it meant ""unfamiliar or not well known."" As the meaning developed, the word came to mean ""rude, vulgar, or lacking refinement."" Interestingly, the word <i>uncouth</i> came first and its antonym, <i>couth</i>, was developed to describe someone who is cultured, polished, and sophisticated. Although <i>couth</i> gets an entry in the dictionary, you will still hear the word <i>uncouth</i> used far more often."
Undulate,"<i>Undulate</i> means to move in a wave-like pattern. If a sound increases and decreases in pitch or volume like waves, you can say the sound is <i>undulating</i>. When searching for the lost boy, the rescuers' cries <i>undulated</i> through the forest.<br><br>The verb <i>undulate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>undula</i>, which means ""wavelet"" (<i>unda</i> means ""wave""). So any action shown with the verb <i>undulate</i> has that waving sense to it. If something moves in a wavy, pattern, for example, it is said to undulate. The wind might cause prairie grass to undulate, or music might cause hips to undulate."
Unilateral,"<i>Unilateral</i> means ""one-sided.""  If parents make a <i>unilateral</i> decision to eliminate summer vacation, it means that the students’ opinions or opposing views weren’t considered.<br><br>When someone makes a unilateral decision, he or she acts alone, without considering the feelings, opposing opinions or concerns of others. But it’s not always a bad thing to act unilaterally. If you are in a fight with your sister and haven’t spoken to each other for a week, you could choose to do her chores, compliment her or make other unilateral, good-faith efforts to bring the bad feelings to an end."
Unimpeachable,"<i>Unimpeachable</i> describes someone or something that is totally, completely, without any doubt, innocent and good, like an <i>unimpeachable</i> role model who avoids bad influences and sketchy situations.<br><br><i>Impeach</i> means ""to accuse, or charge with a crime."" It is a verb usually reserved for when high-ranking officials like presidents do something wrong. So, when you add the prefix <i>un-</i> and the suffix <i>-able</i>, the result is an adjective that means ""not able to be accused,"" in other words, beyond doubt or question. If you run for public office and your past is unimpeachable, your opponents will have nothing to use against you in their advertisements."
Unkempt,"<i>Unkempt</i> literally means “not combed,” but use it to describe anything with a sloppy appearance. Your hair probably looks <i>unkempt</i> when you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep it that way if you're going for the rock star look.<br><br>From the fusing of <i>un-</i> “not” with <i>kempt</i> “neat” comes the adjective <i>unkempt</i>. <i>Kempt</i> has fallen out of use, but <i>unkempt</i> persists as a popular word to describe anything unpolished, rough, or disorderly. Pig sties, the corrals where pigs live, are usually quite unkempt. That's why your mom keeps calling your messy, unkempt train wreck of a room a pig sty."
Unperturbed,"If you stay calm and unruffled most of the time, you can say you're generally <i>unperturbed</i>. Your cat might be <i>unperturbed</i> by the noise of the vacuum cleaner, while it makes your dog hide under the bed and tremble.<br><br>People who are unperturbed aren't bothered or worried. You might be unperturbed by the scary noises your old house makes at night, because you know it's just the wind. Some people are terrified of flying on airplanes, while most remain completely unperturbed, even during bumpy, turbulent flights. When you're <i>perturbed</i>, you're bothered, from the Latin root <i>perturbare</i>, ""to confuse, disorder, or disturb."" When you're <i>unperturbed</i>, you stay cool."
Unscrupulous,"Use the adjective <i>unscrupulous</i> to describe someone who behaves in a dishonest or unethical way.<br><br>Unscrupulous behavior is the unfortunate resort of many ambitious people — it’s the immoral stuff they do to make success more attainable. When you sell someone bad loans, when you hack into your competition's accounts, when you read your roommate's mail for signs of an opportunity with his girlfriend, you're being unscrupulous."
Unsolicited,"Something <i>unsolicited</i> was not asked for and possibly not wanted. <i>Unsolicited</i> calls and advice come whether we want them or not.<br><br>One very common use of this word is in discussing ""<i>unsolicited</i> advice"" or feedback, which definitely has a negative spin. If someone is butting into your business, telling you what you should do, they're giving unsolicited advice. Junk mail is unsolicited. Phone calls trying to sell you something are unsolicited. <i>Unsolicited</i> seems negative, but it can be used positively. If you give compliments that are unsolicited, then you offer them spontaneously and honestly — that's something people like."
Uppity,"People might describe you as <i>uppity</i> if you're bossy and stuck-up. An <i>uppity</i> waiter at a fancy restaurant might look visibly disgusted if you wear your oldest sneakers and your overalls to dinner.<br><br>Someone who's a snob or who acts like a pompous know-it-all deserves to be described as <i>uppity</i>. It's an informal way to talk about a snooty or arrogant person, and it first appeared in African American English in the nineteenth century. The initial published use of <i>uppity</i> was in ""Uncle Remus,"" a collection of African American folk stories adapted by a white journalist in 1881."
Urbane,"<i>Urbane</i> people are sophisticated, polished, cultured, refined. Spend enough time in an <i>urban</i> setting–-going to concerts and museums, spending time in crowds––and you'll be <i>urbane</i> too.<br><br>Both <i>urbane</i> and <i>urban</i> derive from the Latin <i>urbanus</i>, ""city,"" but while <i>urban</i> has connotations of gritty living and crime, <i>urbane</i> assumes that everyone sees the city from the roof deck of their penthouse apartment, drinking champagne and exchanging <i>bon mots</i> with friends. Add a Cole Porter soundtrack and the image is complete."
Utterly,"<i>Utterly</i> is an intensifying word: something <i>utterly</i> delicious is very, very delicious.<br><br>One thing people love to do is exaggerate. You often hear people talking about how awesome or awful things are. When you're laying it on thick, <i>utterly</i> is an utterly useful word: it means something similar to <i>completely</i>, <i>totally</i>, or <i>very</i>. Something utterly disappointing is extremely disappointing. Something utterly wonderful is wonderful times ten. When you get tired of writing <i>very</i>, <i>utterly</i> is a good word choice."
Vacuous,"Reserved for the harmlessly stupid and truly meaningless, <i>vacuous</i> is a smart-sounding way to describe something dumb. Celebrity gossip and reality TV are usually pretty <i>vacuous</i>, even if they're fun.<br><br>If someone smiles at you in a way that seems fake or empty, you could describe the smile as vacuous.  An example of a vacuous comment would be a politician promising to make things better without explaining how.  If something is vacuous, it's like a vacuum — hollow, empty, devoid of substance."
Vagrant,"A <i>vagrant</i> is someone who is homeless and poor and may wander from place to place. In fiction a vagrant often is a criminal, but a real-life vagrant might just be a person who has lost a job and family and lives off the streets with help from charity.<br><br>Many synonyms for <i>vagrant</i> imply laziness and criminal behavior, such as ""bum,"" ""tramp,"" and ""vagabond,"" and some vagrants do make money through crime. Often, though, a vagrant is a down-on-his-luck person who has lost work, family, or health and lives on the streets. European roots for <i>vagrant</i> point to ""wander"" or ""wander about,"" and a vagrant is a wanderer — a man or woman without a place to call home."
Vanguard,"If you are in the <i>vanguard</i>, you're up front. It could be that you are in the <i>vanguard</i> of an advancing army, or in the <i>vanguard</i> of any movement, trend, or occupation.<br><br><i>Vanguard</i> is an old variation of the French word <i>avant-garde</i> meaning ""fore-guard"" or ""front guard."" <i>Vanguard</i> and <i>avant-garde</i> have the same basic meaning, but <i>avant-garde</i> generally describes artistic endeavors, while <i>vanguard</i> can be more widely applied. You might talk about the vanguard of fashion on the red carpet, the vanguard of medical research at a university, or the vanguard of a political movement at a demonstration."
Vapid,"Reserve the adjective <i>vapid</i> for the airhead in your office who brings nothing to the table, except maybe the doughnuts. <i>Vapid</i> is an adjective to describe someone or something that is dull or uninspiring.<br><br>""We prefer not to consider the shockingly <i>vapid</i> and primitive comments uttered by athletes in postcontest interviews,"" David Foster Wallace wrote. The word was originally used in English in a much more literal sense, describing beverages that lacked flavor. It comes from the Latin word <i>vapidus</i>, literally ""having exhaled its vapor."""
Vehement,"You can use the adjective <i>vehement</i>  to describe an extremely strong, powerful, or intense emotion or force. The teenager argued for a much later curfew in a vehement speech to her parents; her parents responded with an equally vehement “No way!”<br><br><i>Vehement</i> is from Latin and was originally applied to intense natural phenomena: pain, heat, wind, etc. It is now more commonly used for intense emotions or beliefs. With the adverb form, people can be vehemently in favor of something, but the more common usage is for people to be vehemently opposed to something. Many people, for example, are vehemently opposed to politicians they didn't vote for, other people spoiling the endings of movies or books, or someone else taking the last piece of chocolate. The stress is on the first syllable (VEE-uh-ment)."
Venal,"Someone with <i>venal</i> motives is corrupt and maybe a little evil. Nobody wants to be thought of as <i>venal</i>.<br><br>Venal actions include taking bribes, giving jobs to your friends, and cheating. <i>Venal</i> means about the same thing as ""corrupt"" or ""corruptible."" Venal people are considered sleazy and untrustworthy. They're often criminals. No one is perfect, and most of us have venal motives at some point."
Venerable,"To be <i>venerable</i> is to be admired and respected because of your status or age. You become <i>venerable</i> by achieving great things or just by living long enough.<br><br>The adjective <i>venerable</i> means ""admired"" and ""respected"" — it should describe how you feel about old folks and bosses, for example. It describes the wise old man at the top of the mountain who tells you the meaning of life. As a noun, the <i>Venerable</i> refers to someone high up in a religion, usually Christian. In fact, Saint Bede, who is sometimes called the Father of English History, is often referred to as the Bede the Venerable."
Vengeance,"If someone hurts you, you might be inspired to plan an act of <i>vengeance</i>: some type of payback in order to settle the score. Be careful, though, because you might inspire someone to take <i>vengeance</i> on you in return.<br><br>Vengeance is a downward spiral of pain and betrayal, one person hurting another, who hurts another, and so on. You might demand vengeance if your brother throws your favorite jeans into a tree, and your brother might feel the same way after you spit gum in his hair. The phrase “with a <i>vengeance</i>” means to do something with a lot of intensity. <i>Vengeance</i> shares roots with the word <i>revenge</i>, and someone who wants revenge usually pursues it with a vengeance."
Venial,"Some crimes are unforgivable. Others are <i>venial</i> — <i>venial</i> crimes and sins are excusable. They're not a big deal.<br><br>In school, there are so many things that are against the rules: talking during class, tossing spitballs, pulling the fire alarm, stealing a basketball, etc. Something <i>venial</i> would be something against the rules but forgivable. For example, if you were late for school because your parents were in the hospital, that lateness is venial. If you burned the gym down, that could never be considered venial. When you see <i>venial</i>, think ""forgivable,"" ""excusable,"" and ""no biggie."""
Verdant,"When something is green with plant life it's <i>verdant,</i> a word often used to idealize the countryside with its <i>verdant</i> pastures or <i>verdant</i> hills.<br><br>Here's a trick for internalizing <i>verdant's</i> meaning: If you speak Spanish, think of <i>verde</i> — meaning ""green."" If you speak French, think of <i>vert</i>. Both French and Spanish inherited their words for <i>green</i> from Latin, in which green is <i>viridis</i>. <i>Verdant</i> also can mean grass-colored: ""She wore a dress of <i>verdant</i> green."""
Vermin,"<i>Vermin</i> is a catch-all term that can be used for any small animals or insects that we think of as pests. The cockroaches you found in your bathroom were the grossest <i>vermin</i> you'd ever seen.<br><br>The word <i>vermin</i> originally came from the Anglo-French word of the same spelling, meaning ""noxious animals"" — definitely a negative term. Rats, mice, cockroaches, along with pests to farmers and the animals they raise, like coyotes and weasels, are vermin. Annoying people who cause problems are also sometimes called <i>vermin</i>, like the vermin who bully others."
Vernacular,"<i>Vernacular</i> describes everyday language, including slang, that's used by the people. The <i>vernacular</i> is different from literary or official language: it's the way people really talk with each other, like how families talk at home.<br><br>You know how some language is fancy and formal? Vernacular is different: think of it as how friends talk when no one is listening. Vernacular language includes slang and obscenities. One of the hardest things about writing for school is getting away from the vernacular and learning to write in more formal ways that don't come as naturally. You can also say specific groups have a vernacular, meaning the unique way people in a certain region or profession speak."
Versatile,"To describe a person or thing that can adapt to do many things or serve many functions, consider the adjective <i>versatile</i>.<br><br>In E.B. White's classic children's book <i>Charlotte's Web</i>, Charlotte the spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is versatile. ""What does 'versatile' mean — full of eggs?"" Wilbur asks. ""Certainly not,"" Charlotte replies. ""'Versatile' means I can turn with ease from one thing to another."" Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word reflects its Latin root, <i>versatilis</i>, ""turning around; revolving."" It eventually came to describe someone who is multi-talented: a singer-songwriter-actress-model would be a versatile figure in the entertainment world."
Vex,"If something <i>vexes</i> you, it brings you trouble or difficulty. In other words, it annoys, worries, distresses, irritates, bothers, or puzzles you.<br><br><i>Vex</i> can be used as an adjective: for example, a <i>vexing</i> issue is not easily solved. The verb <i>vex</i>, the corresponding adjective <i>vexatious</i>, and the noun <i>vexation</i> are all slightly old-fashioned though still in current use. <i>Vex</i> descends from Middle English <i>vexen,</i> from Middle French <i>vexer,</i> from Latin <i>vexare</i> ""to shake, attack, trouble."""
Viable,"When something is <i>viable</i>, it has the ability to grow or function properly. A <i>viable</i> seed can develop into a plant, while a <i>viable</i> company has the resources to succeed.<br><br>The adjective <i>viable</i> refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of the Latin roots <i>vita</i> which means ""life,"" and the ending <i>-able</i> which means ""to be possible."" In terms of science or botany, when a plant is <i>viable</i> it can live and flourish in an environment such as a cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a <i>viable</i> airplane after many tries and spectacular failures."
Vice,"A <i>vice</i> is a moral failing or a bad habit. Traditional examples of <i>vice</i> include drinking alcohol, smoking tobacco, and gambling in card games.<br><br>In the United States, municipal police departments often have a bureau dedicated to vice, manned by vice cops, whose job it is to fight crime related to alcohol, drugs, and gambling. But anything can be a vice, as long as there's someone out there who views it as bad behavior or a moral weakness. You might say, casually, ""I don't drink, smoke, or gamble. Chocolate ice cream is my vice."" Or driving over the speed limit. Or intentionally failing to sort your recycling."
Vicinity,"If something is in your <i>vicinity</i>, it's in the surrounding area or nearby region — it's in the neighborhood, so to speak. If there's a garbage dump in your <i>vicinity</i>, you'll certainly smell it.<br><br>The noun <i>vicinity</i> evolved from the Latin <i>vicinitas</i>, which means “of or pertaining to neighbors or a neighborhood.” Not until 1796 did the word expand in meaning to also describe a “surrounding district.” Said American author Washington Irving, “A kind heart is a fountain of gladness, making everything in its <i>vicinity</i> freshen into smiles.” Slang for <i>vicinity</i> include <i>neck of the woods</i> and <i>turf</i>."
Vigilant,"Use <i>vigilant</i> to describe someone who keeps awake and alert in order to avoid danger or problems. When taking the subway, be <i>vigilant</i> about your wallet––always know where it is, or someone might steal it from you.<br><br><i>Vigilant</i> descends from Latin <i>vigilans,</i> from <i>vigilare </i> ""to be awake, watch,"" from <i>vigil</i> ""awake, alert."" If you stay awake all night, you're keeping watch or keeping a <i>vigil</i>. A <i>vigilante</i> (pronounced vij-uh-LAN-tee) is a person who acts outside the legal system to punish crime."
Vindicate,"<i>Vindicate</i> means to justify, prove, or reinforce an idea — or to absolve from guilt. If your family thinks you hogged the last piece of pie on Thanksgiving, you'll be <i>vindicated</i> when your younger brother fesses up.<br><br><i>Vindicate</i> derives from the Latin <i>vindicatus</i>, which is the past tense of <i>vindicare</i>, meaning ""lay claim to"" or ""avenge."" When a physicist proves a theory that his colleagues derided, he vindicates it. When a lawyer clears her client's name in a trial, she vindicates him. Machiavelli argued that the results he got vindicated his tactics — in other words, the ends justified the means."
Vindictive,"It is no fun hanging out with <i>vindictive</i> people, who are forever out to get back at people they think have hurt them. If you forget to say hello to them one day in the hall, they will carry a grudge against you into next week.<br><br>Vindictive is often paired with mean, as in ""the atmosphere of the cheerleading squad at my new school was vindictive and mean and I wanted nothing to do with it."" <i>Vindictive</i> rumors show a spirit full of revenge. <i>Vindictive</i> is from Latin <i>vindicta</i> ""revenge."" The related Latin verb <i>vindicare</i> has the very different meaning ""to defend or clear someone from guilt,"" and this is the source of the English verb <i>vindicate</i>."
Viscera,"If someone calls you a gutless coward, he's telling you that you lack both courage and <i>viscera</i>. Your <i>viscera</i> are your innards or your guts. In popular usage the term refers to the intestines, but technically it includes all soft internal organs.<br><br><i>Viscera</i> comes from the Latin <i>viscus</i>, meaning ""an inner part of the body."" You won't hear it much nowadays unless you're studying anatomy or describing particularly gory special effects. (Parents object to ultra-violent videogames where bodies explode, spewing viscera.) Don't confuse it with the related <i>visceral</i>, which does crop up often today and means ""instinctive."" ""She had a <i>visceral</i> reaction to seeing her boyfriend and his hunting pals covered in deer blood and <i>viscera</i>, and dumped him the next day."""
Visceral,"When something's <i>visceral</i>, you feel it in your guts. A <i>visceral</i> feeling is intuitive — there might not be a rational explanation, but you feel that you know what's best, like your <i>visceral</i> reaction against egg salad.<br><br>Your hatred of mice may not be rational, but it is visceral, and every time you see one, you feel like you're going to faint. And when you had to decide whether you were going to stay in Florida or move to Texas, even though you had a good job in Orlando you had a visceral feeling that Texas would be the right choice . . . and it turned out you were meant to be a rancher! <i>Visceral</i> can also mean “relating to the viscera,” with <i>viscera</i> being your organs."
Vitriol,"<i>Vitriol</i> is harsh, nasty criticism.  You may have deserved some blame when the cake didn't rise, but the head chef's stream of <i>vitriol</i> was unnecessary.<br><br>Back in the day, <i>vitriol</i> was the name for sulfuric acid, which burns through just about anything. So think of <i>vitriol</i> as language so mean-spirited and bitter that it could eat through metal: ""As a divorce lawyer, you were familiar with <i>vitriol</i>, but nothing prepared you for the time you wore a Red Sox cap at Yankee Stadium."""
Volition,"When you do something voluntarily, you do it of your own <i>volition,</i> or will. Doing something willingly, or because you agree to it, is doing something of your own volition.<br><br><i>Volition</i> comes from Latin and French roots meaning ""wish"" or ""will."" Legal speech and writing often include the word <i>volition,</i> as a way to affirm that a person involved in a crime acted ""on their own <i>volition,</i>"" or consented to be part of the crime. Maybe criminals don't wish to go to jail, but their acts often show their volition to break the law."
Voracious,"<i>Voracious</i> is an adjective used to describe a wolflike appetite. It might be a craving for food or for something else, such as power, but the word usually denotes an unflattering greediness.<br><br><i>Voracious</i> comes from the Latin <i>vorāre</i>, ""to devour."" The word is usually associated with swallowing or devouring food in a ravenous manner, but it can be used of someone intensely involved in any activity. Pierre Salinger referred to President Kennedy as a ""<i>voracious</i> reader,"" while Robert Bakker once likened the IRS to a ""voracious, small-minded predator."""
Voussoir,"A <i>voussoir</i> is a wedge-shaped stone used in building arches and vaults. If you’re building an arch, or any other curved shape, rectangle bricks just won’t do. You need a <i>voussoir</i> or two!<br><br>One type of building block is named by the French word <i>voussoir</i>. A voussoir is a stone block that’s wedge shaped, like a piece of pie with a bite taken out. Since it takes more than one to build with, the word is usually plural. Voussoirs are used to make specific buildings — arches and tombs. The rounded form of an arch is tricky to build, and the wedge shape of voussoirs helps them fit together."
Wager,"To <i>wager</i> is to bet: you might say to your fellow train passengers, ""I'll <i>wager</i> ten dollars that we won't get to Chicago on time.""<br><br>You can use the word <i>wager</i> as either a noun or a verb, to mean ""place a bet"" or ""the amount of money being risked in a bet."" So you could offer a wager at the poker table, or ask if anyone wants to wager on Monday's football game. Either way you use it, <i>wager</i> is a Middle English word that comes from the Old North French <i>wage</i>, ""to pledge."""
Wanton 1.,"<i>Wanton</i> describes something excessive, uncontrolled and sometimes even cruel. The principal sees a food fight as a <i>wanton</i> act of vandalism done with <i>wanton</i> disregard for the rules, but the kids might just see it as fun.<br><br><i>Wanton</i> comes from the Old English <i>wan-</i> ""lacking"" and <i>togen</i> ""to train, discipline,"" in other words, ""lacking in discipline."" Wanton extravagance is excessive and uncontrolled, whereas a wanton act of terrorism is random and intentionally cruel. Sometimes in older novels, you will see <i>wanton</i> used as a disapproving term to describe a sexually active person, particularly a woman, a usage that is considered old-fashioned today."
Wanton 2.,"<i>Wanton</i> describes something excessive, uncontrolled and sometimes even cruel. The principal sees a food fight as a <i>wanton</i> act of vandalism done with <i>wanton</i> disregard for the rules, but the kids might just see it as fun.<br><br><i>Wanton</i> comes from the Old English <i>wan-</i> ""lacking"" and <i>togen</i> ""to train, discipline,"" in other words, ""lacking in discipline."" Wanton extravagance is excessive and uncontrolled, whereas a wanton act of terrorism is random and intentionally cruel. Sometimes in older novels, you will see <i>wanton</i> used as a disapproving term to describe a sexually active person, particularly a woman, a usage that is considered old-fashioned today."
Warrant,"If you watch cop shows, you know that a <i>warrant</i> is something police need to get into your house — a permission slip from a judge.<br><br>It's a noun! It's a verb! It's a word that <i>warrants</i> our attention! As a noun, it's the piece of paper they show you through the keyhole during an investigation. It's also a reason for doing something, or a promise (think of the <i>warranty</i> on your new car, the promise that it'll work for a certain amount of time). As a verb, it means to make something seem reasonable or necessary, such when the ticking suitcase <i>warrants</i> bringing in the bomb squad, or when the teenager's sneaking in late again <i>warrants</i> a stricter curfew."
Watershed,"A <i>watershed</i> is a turning point, or historic moment. The day you got your braces off might have been a <i>watershed</i> moment in your life.<br><br><i>Watershed</i> is a geographical term, originally. The area that drains into a single river is the watershed for that river. <i>Watershed</i> can also mean a ridge, like that formed by a chain of mountains, which sends water to two different rivers on either side. It's from this meaning that <i>watershed</i> came to mean a turning point or dividing line in social life."
Wayward,"Someone <i>wayward</i> is a little stubborn and independent — they're determined to find their own way and are not easily controlled.<br><br>Being wayward can mean a few things, but they all have something to do with doing your own thing — often, going against what others want you to do. A rebellious student is wayward. A son who ignores his parent's advice is wayward. A politician who goes against everyone else in his political party is wayward. Wayward folks like to go their own way — and they often take the unexpected path."
Wean,"To <i>wean</i> yourself from something is to gradually eliminate that thing from your life. You may want to <i>wean</i> yourself from watching too much TV, drinking two pots of coffee every morning, or obsessively reading the celebrity columns.<br><br>To wean an infant — human or animal — you gradually reduce consumption of mother’s milk or bottled milk until the little one is no longer nursing or bottle-feeding. If you want to wean yourself from eating chocolate chip cookies, go from eating eight a day to only seven for the next few days, then to six for a few days and so on until you're no longer eating any chocolate chip cookies."
Wondrous,"The adjective <i>wondrous</i> is a great word to use when you're describing something amazing or delightful. You could talk about the <i>wondrous</i> view of the ocean from the cliffs where you're standing.<br><br>There's a hint of magic and awe about the word <i>wondrous</i>. It describes things that inspire wonder, like a wondrous imaginary land or a wondrous display of beautiful, elaborate cakes at a pastry shop. The root is the Old English <i>wundor</i>, ""marvelous thing, or object of astonishment."" <i>Wondrous</i> is tricky to spell because it's missing the <i>e</i> in <i>wonder</i>."
Wrangle 1.,"To <i>wrangle</i> is to take part in a long, angry, intense argument, especially over an issue with lots of details. You can also <i>wrangle</i>, or herd, a bunch of cows. Politicians and lawyers frequently <i>wrangle</i>, no cows necessary.<br><br><i>Wrangle</i> in its current meaning comes from the nineteenth century American term <i>wrangling</i>, the art of herding cattle, probably with the idea in mind that rounding up those tiresome details is a bit like rounding up all those tiresome cattle; they tend to go flying off in all directions. From <i>wrangler</i> in the cowboy sense we get Wrangler jeans, though not all wranglers wear Wranglers of course."

Wrest,"To <i>wrest</i> is to forcefully grab or take something away. You can <i>wrest</i> away many things, such as remote controls and championships.<br><br>This word is strong and a little violent. It's not easy to wrest something away. <i>Wresting</i> away is a little like ""wrestling"" something away — you can't get it without a fight. Objects can be <i>wrested</i> away, but so can non-physical things. In a tough election, you could say the new president <i>wrests</i> away the title of commander-in-chief from the incumbent candidate."
Wry,"A <i>wry</i> sense of humor is a sarcastic one. You were late for work, stepped into a mud puddle, and you forgot your lunch. If your co-worker asks how your morning is going, you can reply with a <i>wry</i> tone, ""Perfectly perfect.""<br><br>The original use for the adjective <i>wry</i> was to describe something that was bent or twisted, so a sprained ankle could be described as ""a <i>wry</i> ankle."" Today, the word <i>wry</i> is often used to describe less tangible twists. Wry humor and wry wit both describe a sense of humor that is a little twisted from the norm."
Yoke 1.,"Ever seen a picture of a farm girl carrying two buckets of water hanging from ropes attached to a stick she's balancing across her shoulders? That stick on her shoulders is a <i>yoke</i>.<br><br><i>Yoke</i> also can mean the stick that connects two work animals together, or the act of connecting two things together as with a yoke. A classic tool of farmers for centuries, the yoke has also become a symbol of oppression — no one wants to live under the yoke of a tyrant's rule. Do not confuse <i>yoke</i> with yolk, the yellow part of an egg."

Do not confuse <i>yoke</i> with yolk, the yellow part of an egg."
Zealot,"The hamburger <i>zealot</i> was so fanatical about his burgers that he camped outside his favorite fast-food joint for hours every morning, waiting for it to open. And he would never put mustard on them, only ketchup.<br><br>The original <i>zealots</i> were a group of first-century Jews who were absolutely determined to overthrow Roman rule in Palestine. Today, anyone who is goes overboard in their <i>zeal</i>, or enthusiasm, for a particular cause, a religion, a sports team, or a charitable organization — can be called a <i>zealot</i>. The coffee lover was a zealot regarding where his coffee was grown, who grew it, and how it was roasted."
